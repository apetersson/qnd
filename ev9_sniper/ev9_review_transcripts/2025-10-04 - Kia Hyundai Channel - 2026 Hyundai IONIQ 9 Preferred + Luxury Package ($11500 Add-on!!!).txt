[00:00] Gabby, and this is the 2026 Hyundai Ionic 9 in the preferred trim with the
[00:06] luxury package. Now, I know this naming sequence is not entirely easy to understand, and that's why in today's
[00:12] live stream video, we're going to go over everything that you'll get in the luxury package and also explain the
[00:18] Ionic lineup, period. Because it can be a fairly confusing car, and Hyundai Canada's website is it's interesting.
[00:24] I'll I'll put it there. Now, on this channel, we do live stream car reviews every single weekday at 2 pm Eastern
[00:29] Standard Time, where we'll typically highlight one specific vehicle and sometimes we do comparisons. Lately, we've been filming a lot of Kia EV9,
[00:37] which is actually the cousin of the Ionic 9 we're filming here today. And I say cousin because although these
[00:43] vehicles are built on the same platform and will share a lot of the same technology and even interfaces, we've
[00:50] got some pretty large mechanical differences on the Ionic 9, which could make it a winner if you're cross
[00:55] shopping between the two. Now, to familiarize yourself with this exact trim level, it is based off the
[01:01] preferred all-wheel drive model, which features an all-wheel drive setup. So, we have an electric motor in the front,
[01:07] that's a 70 kW electric motor, and then also one in the rear. That one's 160 kW.
[01:13] This is actually the less powerful all-wheel drive configuration because if you didn't know, the Ionic has three
[01:18] different powertrains. You can get a rear wheel drive setup, the all-wheel drive we have here today, or the extra
[01:24] powerful all-wheel drive that features two 160 kW motors, one in the front, one
[01:30] in the rear. Anyway, let's take a look at the front end first. We'll talk powertrain, exterior design, and then
[01:35] work our way throughout the entire vehicle. Adam's going to flip over the camera right now and I'll also mention
[01:40] the price point. So, this vehicle is priced at $764.99 Canadian. That is actually quite
[01:47] affordable when you think about an all electric three row SUV. The luxury trim
[01:54] level will also be the highest trim you can get while still retaining the seven seats because the model above it's a
[02:00] six-seater. So, if you need all the seats in the house and you want the comforts and the luxury, this is the one for you. On the front end, let's start
[02:06] off with our daytime running lamp. Now, it expands all the way across this very,
[02:11] very, very large vehicle. It has those pixelated design elements that are kind of a trademark on the Ionic lineup. We
[02:18] first saw it on the five, now it's all the way up to the nine. This car definitely has a futuristic look, but it's also retro at the same time. Your
[02:26] main headlamp unit's positioned a little bit lower, kind of similar to the Hyundai Palisade, and it's still in a
[02:31] fantastic light beam level, so you can see no problems. There's incredible visibility. LEDs are standard across all
[02:39] trim levels, so that is kind of a given at a vehicle at this price point. But with a sharp beam like this and the fact
[02:45] that they're LEDs, they'll last you a whole lot longer and be more energy efficient. Style-wise, they also look
[02:50] good because we still maintain those pixelated elements just in a much larger scale. Come more towards the side and we
[02:57] have some smaller points along the headlamps unit. Pretty cool. The more you look at this car, the more intricate
[03:03] details you'll pick up and that's definitely an emphasis from what Kia does. I do think Kia is a little bit more simple, sometimes more sporty in
[03:10] their styling where Hyundai tends to make things more unique, more intricate, more Let me know what you guys think,
[03:17] though. For our front, we also have parking sensors. So, these ultrasonic circular sensors will give you a beep
[03:23] inside the cabin anytime you approach something too closely. This will also be our introductory trim level to a full
[03:29] 360° camera. So, the first camera we'll see on the outside is located right smack dab in the center of our front
[03:35] end. This one will show you exactly what's ahead of you if you're approaching, let's say, a wall or a
[03:40] vehicle right in front. When the sensors pick up an obstacle, it shows the camera for the corresponding camera. Very
[03:46] handy. Now, another thing I want to point out across our electric lineup, more and more we're seeing these active
[03:52] air vents. So, right now they're completely open. However, if I were to shut the car off, this would shut down
[03:57] and close. I'll do that in a second. This just allows air to flow through the vehicle, improving your aerodynamics,
[04:03] but also your cooling. The vehicle will automatically open or close them as it seems fit. So, if you hear a little bit
[04:08] of a worring noise, it's just actively inhaling. It's breathing. All right,
[04:13] let's turn off the car. You guys can see the lights shut off and likely our air vents close.
[04:21] Did they close? Awesome. Now, I'm also going to turn on the hazard lamp so you guys can see what
[04:27] your turn signal indicators would look like. They also go towards your mirrors.
[04:32] And on this trim level, it's where we'll start with our power folding mirrors. So, if that is something that you find a
[04:39] mustave, this will be your trim level to start it. All right, I'm going to pop the hood for
[04:45] y'all. Now, of course, there won't be an engine under there, but we do have a frunk. This is a 52 L frunk, too. So,
[04:54] while it may not be the largest in the electric vehicle world, it's actually still pretty useful. Hydraulic hood.
[05:00] Nice and easy. And here we go. That is our frunk space. So, it's actually large enough that there's an emergency frunk
[05:07] release in case you ever get stuck in there, you can release it. This will also be your access to your
[05:12] air filter if you ever decide to replace it yourself. So, pop this open and you can access it nice and easy. All right.
[05:20] Now, I know with EVs it always looks a little strange seeing what's under the hood because it's not a whole lot. I
[05:26] guess it really depends what you put there, but got our washer fluid. That's something that you still got to do on an
[05:32] electric vehicle. Nice. Now, let's move on over to our wheels because we do get
[05:37] a specialized wheel design on the luxury trim level. Now, if I didn't mention it earlier on in this video, the luxury
[05:43] trim is a $11,500 add-on from the preferred model below
[05:49] it. So, these 20-in alloys are exclusive here. You'll notice there is a pretty
[05:55] big chunkiness to them, and that's actually intentional. These are called Aeroblade style wheels. You'll see them
[06:01] on a lot of electric vehicles. And it may look kind of counterintuitive. They look blocky or like they might be heavy.
[06:07] It's actually for air flow. So, it's going to minimize air resistance and maximize the flow, increasing your air
[06:12] efficiency in your aerodynamics. That's also the big reason why we have pop out door handles on just about every
[06:19] electric car. These door handles will retract when the vehicle's in motion or locked and then pop right out when you
[06:25] walk up to your vehicle to allow you to easily get into the car. Pretty cool. Some people ask about that, some people
[06:31] don't care, but I will point out that the Ionic 9 does have specialized badging within the handle itself. So, a
[06:37] little bit of extra flare, a little bit more design, and on a luxury trim, it really makes sense. A couple other
[06:43] add-ons that the luxury trim gets you as far as exterior aesthetics. We have gloss black wheel arches with a little
[06:50] section of body color, too. This specific paint color is quite unique. I
[06:55] don't know what it looks like on camera cuz I'm not currently watching the live stream. I'm here. But it's it's a silver
[07:02] or a gray. They call it a gray, but there is a lot of green shine to it. It's almost pearlescent in its
[07:08] appearance. So, in exterior lighting or natural lighting, you'll see a lot more depth and dimension that our artificial
[07:14] lights in here don't necessarily bring out the best of. Adam, do you have your cell phone on you?
[07:20] Yes, I do. All right. We're going to turn the flash on on Adam's phone and hope that we can pick up
[07:26] the lights. Yeah. Do you want to go ahead and do it then? So, while Adam shows you guys the paint flex, I'll give
[07:31] you a couple more breakdowns, nerdy breakdowns about the car. So, again, this is our all-wheel drive preferred
[07:37] model at its core. There's also preferred plus where you can add on the calligraphy package. It's an $11,000 500
[07:44] add-on to get the luxury we have here today. And we have the 70 kW electric motor on the front with the 160 in the
[07:51] rear. Now, how did that paint look, Adam? Uh, so the paint code is called Caliodon
[07:58] Gray. I will try to pronounce that, fact check the pronunciation later on in this
[08:03] video, but it is very unique. It looks nothing like what Hyundai Canada's website configurator shows. It just
[08:09] shows silver on there. There's definitely a lot more than silver in real life. So, mirrors, like I said, are
[08:15] body color and they are power folding on this trim level. That's where it starts. You'll also get the inclusion of a blind
[08:21] view monitor when you opt for the preferred. So, this little camera will show you exactly what's happening in
[08:27] your blind spot every time you go to indicate a lane change or just really trigger your turn signal. So, even if
[08:32] you're parallel parking, you can see exactly where your vehicle will end up in terms of the curbs beside you. For
[08:38] your belt line, it's satin chrome and then your pillars will be finished in gloss black. The lower portion of the
[08:45] car also has more details of gloss black with a tad bit of body color peeking out
[08:50] and then right back to black. So, a little bit of a sandwiched material, but honestly, it works on this car. If
[08:57] you're concerned about braking or you want to know the specs on the braking, we do have ventilated disc brakes both on the front and in the rear. And of
[09:03] course, they're going to be quite large on this vehicle. When we're talking about EVs, it's only right that we also
[09:09] mention regenerative braking. So Kia and Hyundai do a great job at integrating the regenerative braking levels on the
[09:15] steering wheel so you can adjust it on the fly. If you're someone who loves to use it at a full eye pedal or one pedal
[09:21] style driving, that's an option. But there's also a smart or automated function that lets the car decide how
[09:27] much force to use depending on the traffic conditions or the slope of the road. Regenerative braking takes your
[09:32] electric motor and instead of using it to propel you forwards, it kind of reverses its role and instead becomes a
[09:38] generator supplying some power back into your battery to lo use later on while driving, not lose. This is great because
[09:45] on a regular gas car that would essentially be wasted energy that's just heat that's going elsewhere. But in this
[09:51] car, it actually gives you a little bit more power. Very, very handy. And less wear on your mechanical or friction
[09:56] brakes. So, you can extend the lifespan of your brakes while also slowing your car down and getting some power back.
[10:02] Sounds like a win in my books. All right, I didn't know if I talked about the battery capacity yet. So, this is
[10:08] 110.3 kWh lithium ion polymer battery. There is only one battery capacity
[10:14] available for the Ioni 9 on all of its trim levels. The only differences, of course, are the size of the electric
[10:20] motors and their placement, of course, if you're getting the rear wheel drive versus the two options for all-wheel.
[10:26] Pretty cool. Now, along the back end of the vehicle, you'll notice those pixelated light elements travel all the
[10:32] way across our top and down to our side. Within this unit, you'll also find your
[10:38] reverse lights and your turn signal indicators. I'm going to hop in the car, turn everything back on so we can get the actual visual, though.
[10:45] So, we'll start off with the full regular light function, so that'll be illuminated while regularly driving. If
[10:52] I were to hit the brakes, this is what you'd see. All LEDs, of course. And then here are turn signal indicators or our
[10:59] hazard lights. And then if I were to pop this car in reverse, let me just turn the hazards
[11:05] off. Oh, I got to close my door. This car is too safe.
[11:11] There we go. Those are reverse lights. Guys, be honest. Should I hit Adam? He
[11:16] can't hear me right now. All right. Now, as far as range goes on this
[11:21] vehicle, every model of the Ionic 9 is rated at over 500 kilometers of all
[11:27] electric range, which is quite impressive, largely in due to its style, but also its larger battery pack. That
[11:33] is something that no models of the Kia EV9 offer. So, if range is what you're after, the Ionic 9 might be the way to
[11:39] go. For your charge port is a North American charging standard style port.
[11:44] Some people like to call it the Tesla port. We're not calling that here today. We have a state of charge indicator
[11:50] right over here. This will fully illuminate if the car is fully charged and then about halfway if it's half
[11:56] charged. So, just a quick visual. You also have this small LED here that illuminates the port if you are plugging
[12:02] in your vehicle at night time. So, you can see what you're doing. As far as charge times go, this vehicle is based
[12:07] off our 800volt charging in infrastructure architecture. So, what that means is if you do find a
[12:14] 350 kW charger on your travels, you can go from 10% to 80% in 24 minutes if the
[12:21] charger, of course, is at its operating conditions. This vehicle also has an integrated battery management system as
[12:28] well as a heat pump and even manual battery preconditioning. So, if you do live in a cold or warm climate, you can
[12:34] manually precondition your vehicle. So, when you do arrive at your DC charger, your battery temperature is optimal to
[12:40] accept charge immediately. So, save your time and you don't have to use Kia's in-house navigation. Pretty handy. The
[12:47] back end of the vehicle in its dial, we already pointed out the lights, but as far as emblems go, it's pushed in or
[12:53] flat against our body panel. We have our hidden Hyundai motif. It's built into
[12:59] the glass, which is also heated. Then, of course, we have a power lift gate. Oh my gosh. On this vehicle, I always
[13:06] forget. There we go, guys. Too many times we're filming different cars and just
[13:12] you never know. All right, reverse lights or sorry, license plate lights are LEDs. This is a height adjustable
[13:18] lift gate. So, if this is a bit too tall for you, you can manually set it to your exact height by pressing and holding
[13:24] this button once you've repositioned it. For a seating configuration, this is again the highest trim level you can get
[13:30] while retaining the seven seats. We have a bench in the very middle. Those are your three. And then we have two in the
[13:36] rear. Now, the back seats here are actually quite large, so adults can fit in here. Pretty good for an electric
[13:43] SUV. The right hand side, you'll notice we have buttons to power fold both our second and third row. So, the second row
[13:51] will go in sections. The center middle seat is in part with the left hand side.
[13:56] And then the right seat itself folds individually. These seats over here, I can bring them up or down on my command.
[14:04] And like I said before, they're all powered. You do have LED lighting on the
[14:09] side of our cabin. And then to the left of that, you'll notice we have our liftgate release and a 12volt inverter.
[14:17] Now, back to the right side though, I just want to quickly highlight our vehicle to load plugin. So, this is our
[14:23] internal plug. So essentially, even if your vehicle is off, you can still power devices or accessories by using its high
[14:29] voltage batteries charge and not the car's 12volt accessory battery. So if you are someone who likes camping a lot
[14:36] or you know, you just want to plug things in and not wake up to a dead car battery, you can use the driving or high
[14:43] voltage battery of this car and set a limit that you'd let your car go down to. So once it's reached that limit,
[14:48] let's say I do 20%, it'll stop powering whatever device I plugged in. You can use that internal port or use the
[14:55] adapter that comes with the vehicle and plug it into the actual charger. We've done tons of videos on this. If you want
[15:01] to see it in action, definitely check out our channel. Now, I think that's about it for the cargo area. Let's hop
[15:06] inside and familiarize ourselves with the rest of the cabin because there is quite a bit on this car to go over. I
[15:13] just again want to quickly highlight the exterior design materials and how they complement this paint color so nicely.
[15:18] The mix of the satin chrome with the very very dark gloss black just creates a beautiful contrast and the paint
[15:24] itself just because it's so transitional depending on the lighting. It's a really cool car to look at.
[15:30] All right, so a big upgrade that the luxury trim gets you is the inclusion of
[15:35] ventilated seats up at the front. But your two main seats, both driver and passenger, are also relaxation style
[15:42] seats. So, if you're waiting for a charge or you're just waiting to pick somebody up, throw your car in relax
[15:48] mode and relax. They're both heated and ventilated. You get so many power
[15:53] adjustments that finding your perfect seat won't be too hard. Maybe when you first sit in the car trying to figure
[15:59] out what each button does, but I'll show you that. This first one here is the knee extender. So, if you are a taller
[16:05] driver, this is often very time many times helpful. We got our bottom of the
[16:10] seat. bring closer, further, raise it, lower it, and even tilt it. Then we have
[16:15] our back rest, our lumbar support with four-way control. And here is our
[16:21] relaxation seat. So, if I press and hold, it'll raise my steering wheel.
[16:26] It'll bring my seat a little forwards and then backwards. And I can relax. And the passenger seat
[16:33] does the same thing. Pretty cool. Now, I kind of highlighted it, but not really. Power steering wheel column. This is
[16:40] something we don't see too too often on our cars, but it's really nice to see, especially considering this isn't even the top trim level yet. It's tilt and
[16:47] telescopic, so you can bring it out, push it in, lift it, lower it, whatever way you want it, it can go. And it does
[16:53] it powered. This is all linked, thank goodness, to your memory seats. So, memory seats are also something that
[16:59] starts on this trim level. So, your seat control, your steering wheel, and your mirrors will all be linked to your
[17:05] button presets here. There's a little bit of satin chrome along your door card, but also highlighted on the
[17:10] handle, the slight accent surrounding, and of course, you can probably tell by now, we have some ambient lighting. Set
[17:18] this color to whatever you'd like. Even have it change based off your drive mode, and it'll also be linked to your
[17:23] driver profiles. Mirror and window controls are all here. Your child lock and window locks are in
[17:30] the same button, so they're integrated together. And then for our sound system, the luxury trim gets you our 14 speaker
[17:36] Bose premium audio system. There's a small pocket along the side here. It's
[17:42] got a cool material, too. Don't know what to call that, but it's cool. And then for our door sills, we do get the
[17:48] deluxe Ionic 9 branded material.
[17:53] Quickly take a look at our driver's knee side buttons. So, we have a button to release our charge door. I've got a
[18:00] button for frunk and tailgate release, traction control, brightness adjustment,
[18:05] and electronic parking brake. All of the materials on the luxury trim are quite
[18:10] luxurious, as one would expect. So, that satin chrome expands all the way across
[18:15] our front end. You get the nice touches of ambient lighting, kind of back lighting, the wood grain trim, and it's
[18:22] a bright wood grain, so it really opens up the cabin space because everything else is fairly dark. more peaks of the
[18:29] ambient lighting on our passenger door. Now, the seats are a leatherrett seat.
[18:35] You do get, see if we can zoom in or focus, but are four pixelated dots,
[18:42] which is actually morse code for H. So, little H's everywhere. And the seats are perforated.
[18:48] There is a valet seat for the passenger. So, if people are getting in, they need a little extra space, I can adjust it
[18:54] here without getting out and going towards our side. Our center console has got a lot going on
[19:01] and it's also almost a floating style so there is space right in front of it to put things in between.
[19:09] Got your cup holders decent sized our drive and terrain mode select as well as
[19:14] our auto hold our park view camera and our parking sensors. Now your park view camera will show you your full 360°ree
[19:22] by default. However, if I was reversing, this main image here would be my reverse camera with the side view being the top
[19:28] down. If I was pulling forward last, it shows me my forward camera. So, it always shows you what's deemed most
[19:34] beneficial. It's a smart car. There's a wireless charger just below. And then we
[19:40] have our birectional center console. So, I can open it from the front and access my goods, which they also come with 100
[19:47] watt chargers for the USBC's. Very nice. And then my second row passengers have a
[19:53] latch over here where they can access it from the back seats. Don't tell them about that though if you don't want them going through your stuff. Now for your
[20:00] steering wheel, it's heated with two different levels. You got your driver assistance controls on the lefth hand
[20:06] side, including our highway driving assist, as well as our smart cruise control and our lane keeping and
[20:11] following assist monitored by this button here. By pressing this center or top right button, I can adjust my center
[20:18] display for a digital gauge cluster. So, I can see my range guide, my route if I have something set in my nav, as well as
[20:25] my lane safety. And then right back to our driving stats. There's a ton of different views to choose from. You can
[20:30] do tire pressure, all-wheel drive torque distribution, as well as your trip, both after charging and just general. The
[20:36] lefth hand side is your digital speedometer, and the right is your range guide or your door open warning because
[20:42] the door is open. So you can see our max range, our minimum range, and then our charge and power band. The charge band
[20:48] will show or illuminate boldly. Oh my goodness, it's going to keep popping up. If we're currently coasting or genering,
[20:55] that shows power going back into your battery pack. And then if we're, you know, pedal to the metal, we're more
[21:00] likely going to be on the power side of things. So think of it like your tachometer on a gas car. Same idea.
[21:06] Okay, I'll quickly highlight the main screen. So, this is a 12.3 in touchscreen with our latest software,
[21:14] CCNC. Long name. I'm not going to break it down for you guys, but what you really need to know is although this is very
[21:20] high-tech, it's super easy to understand and the icons are quite large. Not only are they large, they're very smartphone
[21:27] like, so you can move the screen however you want it. If something is more useful for you, like your seat controls, bring
[21:33] it to the front page. If not, you can slide things all the way to the back and not have them in your face. The EV menu
[21:38] is where you'll find things that are electric vehicle related. So, your current range as well as your nearest
[21:44] charger. This vehicle will also share your electricity use and we have so many sub menus that I won't have time to
[21:50] explain them all today, but things like your battery health and your charging history. Now, I quickly want to highlight the battery conditioning menu.
[21:57] So, in the past, some of our EVs, they had battery preconditioning, but in order to actually use it, you had to set
[22:03] a route to a DC fast charger in your vehicle's navigation. It's not the case anymore. So, if you know you're going to
[22:09] be on your way to a fast charger, you can set it whenever you want and not have to use Kia's navigation or
[22:15] Hyundai's navigation, cuz sometimes it's it's not the best, guys.
[22:21] All right, now we'll quickly head back here. Um, as far as Apple CarPlay and Android Auto goes, it's completely
[22:28] wireless on this infotainment screen. So, connect your phone once and then every time you hop in, it'll be
[22:33] wirelessly displayed. Your gear shift is mounted on the steering column. It is a shift by wire,
[22:38] so as long as your foot's on the brake, you are free to tip it into drive, reverse, or P on the end for park like a
[22:44] button. And your ignition is also here, or maybe I should say start button.
[22:49] Mounted on the back are those paddle shifters I mentioned earlier. So left-hand paddle will increase the level
[22:54] of regen. The right paddle will decrease it. You can opt from anywhere between
[23:00] zero regen, level zero I should say, level one, level two, level three, and
[23:06] then I pedal. I pedal is that one pedal style driving that is pretty popular with Teslas and most EVs. Basically, the
[23:13] second you let off the accelerator, it takes you to a complete halt. The brake force is strong with that one. So, if
[23:20] you've ever been in a car with someone who's never driven electric before, chances are it's felt jerky. Almost like you're in a car with someone who's never
[23:25] driven a manual. You get get a feel for it after a couple weeks. That's all I got to say. When I do sell a electric
[23:32] vehicle, I usually mention to them maybe you want to do level one or level two for a little while to get a feel for it and then work your way up to level three
[23:38] or I pedal. Going to have Adam grab the camera and then we'll take a look at the second
[23:44] row. And don't worry, I didn't forget about the passenger seat. We will show that once we're done. on the second and third row. So, right now it looks like a
[23:53] total incomplete mess because I didn't prep the area for today's video, but you
[23:59] can see just how easy the seats are to reconfigure. So, we saw earlier on how there were buttons to power fold or
[24:04] unfold our second and third row seats. However, if you want to do it the oldfashioned way, the top portion or
[24:10] shoulder area will have these buttons. Whoa, hello. That allow them to fold forward. Now, normally the seat back
[24:17] would be up, and if it was up, now you have a very easy hallway to get into the
[24:22] third row. Now, I got to do things the hard way. There we go. And bring the
[24:27] seat back up to regular stand points. Adam, do you think you could do it while recording?
[24:34] Nope, not that button. All righty. Here. Oh my gosh, I am new here. That right
[24:42] over there. Can you grab it, Adam? I can't see. Okay,
[24:48] there we go. All right. So, while these seats are power folding, they are manual to adjust. So, if you are sitting back
[24:55] here and you want to reposition it either on its rail or the amount of recline, you'll grab this handle for the
[25:01] recline. Push with your back a little bit to set it to your liking. And then if I want to give the people behind me
[25:07] more room, I'll reach in between my legs, grab the bar, and then walk myself either as far back or as close up as I'd
[25:15] like. Now, with EVs, you get the benefit of a completely flat floor. So, no matter what seat you're in, let's do the
[25:22] middle one for example. My feet aren't elevated. I'm not in a hunched position, so I'm free to be comfortable. And
[25:28] again, they move separately. So, this one's on its own, and these two are together. As far as convenience goes for
[25:34] our second row, I'll take the camera from you. We have our heated seat controls on the backing of the center
[25:40] console. This will be for your main seats, not the middle. But we also have our temperature control. It's trizone,
[25:46] so I, as a rear passenger, can set it to exactly the temp I like and also adjust the fan speed and the fan direction.
[25:53] Now, where are the fans, you may ask? They are ceiling mounted, so the airflow
[25:59] will actually go towards you and not just your kneecaps. It also transcends to the back seats
[26:04] too, meaning the third row seats in this case. There's a small storage pocket just below. And then of course, we do
[26:10] have access to our center console. Very nice. The backs of the seats will
[26:18] have our storage pockets. And then the door cards will have our
[26:23] cup holders, a touch of ambient lighting, that almost ripple-like effect on the door card itself, and then our
[26:30] satin chrome handles. Along the bottom, you'll notice we have more satin chrome surrounding your Bose premium sound
[26:36] system and that same storage pocket we saw for the driver. Adam, do you mind opening the sunroof while I'm back here?
[26:43] Now, I'm going to show you guys our sun shades. The integrated sun shades start on this trim level.
[26:50] And I'll also point out what else is only starting on this trim. The ambient lighting is one of which. The vents or
[26:58] sorry, the sun shades are another option. The heated seats in the back as well as the ventilated seats in the
[27:03] front. And the big one, the panoramic sunroof only starts on the luxury trim level. Expands all the way towards our
[27:11] third row. So, no matter what seat you're in, you can get a view of the sky or the dirty fingerprints you forgot to
[27:19] clean. All righty. Now, we will get into the third row. And now that we're very
[27:24] familiar with how to knock the seat into third row access position, I'm going to
[27:30] do exactly that. So, by pressing this top shoulder button, which is located on both opposite seats, it'll lift the
[27:37] seat, keeping the back upright. And now I have a very, very wide entryway into
[27:43] the third row. There is also some plastic floor covering here, too. So, come winter time, if you do opt for
[27:49] rubber mats, you're not actually stepping on anywhere that would otherwise be carpeted, or it just makes things a little easier. So, hop in. I'll
[27:58] go to the far left seat. Make sure our headrests are up so it's actually comfortable back here. And this is what
[28:05] we're looking at for space. There is a ton of headroom in this third row. Seriously, a ton. And the windows back
[28:10] here are also quite large, so you can actually see out of them when you're sitting back here. You're not just looking at a wall or the seat in front
[28:17] of you. Each of these seats have car seat tethers, so if you do have little ones in your family, you can position
[28:23] them wherever is most convenient. And then as far as the width goes, I'm very happy they stuck with two seats
[28:29] back here and not three because the two seats are fairly spacious, but a third mm- won't be good. So comfortable and
[28:36] they do recline so I can maneuver the seat to be a little further back if that's my preference and then I can
[28:42] bring it right back up if I'd like. All done by powered controls. There are USBC's on either side and they are 100
[28:49] watt USBC's. You'll find that on the first, second, and third row. So if you have any larger devices like a laptop
[28:56] that might require faster charging or even a phone, it's actually quick. Because the worst part
[29:02] about, I guess, having a dead device in a vehicle is a lot of the
[29:08] times the charging does not it doesn't do much. You have to be in the three-hour car ride to get any substantial charge. So, this fixes that
[29:15] solution, but no one's going to have a dead device on this road trip, especially because Hyundai gave you the power cables.
[29:22] They thought of everything. All right, I think we'll answer some questions. See what you guys have to say about the luxury trim of the Ionic 9. And I'll
[29:28] break down some more exclusives that start on this trim level. Let's get out.
[29:33] And again, this hallway, amazing. The fact that the second row is also on rails, though, really makes it easier to
[29:40] reconfigure your positions. So, if you do have someone taller in the third row and you can sacrifice some second row
[29:46] room, you can do so. You can adjust it at your will. All right, Adam. I'm just gonna There we go.
[29:52] All right, you guys. Let's do a quick breakdown of the pricing again. So, this vehicle is built off of the preferred
[29:58] all-wheel drive, which is $649.99, and it is an $11,500
[30:05] upgrade. Now, what exactly do we get? Well, we covered the big things like the sun shades, the panoramic sunroof, the
[30:12] ventilated seats in the front, the heated seats in the rear, the both relaxation seats for driver and
[30:17] passenger up at the front. But we also get our memory seat function, our power folding mirrors, a couple exclusive
[30:24] design elements like the beautiful gloss black wheel arches, and also the 20-in alloys. So, there is quite a bit both
[30:31] style and comfort wise. This is also the introductory trim level to having that full 360° camera and the blind view
[30:38] monitoring. So, if that's a must have for you, this is the trim level to get. You'll also get both front, rear, and
[30:45] it's not both, triple front, rear, and side parking sensors. So, no matter what kind of maneuver you're doing, there is
[30:51] that visual and audible warning. Um, do you have to pay extra to buy it
[30:56] from the legendary Gabby? So, I actually cannot sell you this car. I do not work for Hyundai. I'm not licensed to sell
[31:03] for Hyundai. I'm just here to show you the car. But, if you want to buy one, Brford Hyundai is the great place to do
[31:08] it. And they actually have this one available there. But,
[31:13] Uh, let's see what you guys have to say about the car so far. Would you take this over the EV9?
[31:20] Let me know. And again, this vehicle, although it is siblings with the EV9, it
[31:25] actually has a larger battery capacity, more available range and some tech that the EV9 doesn't necessarily have.
[31:32] Styling wise, they're also completely different. Um, just want to see if I noticed any
[31:39] specific questions pop out. Um, Samarth said, "I'm confused whether
[31:44] I actually asked about all-wheel drive or anything." So, I'm not sure if you asked earlier on, I didn't see it, but if you're asking about it now, there are
[31:50] three powertrain or drivetrain options for the Ionic 9. The introductory trim level will be a single motor, rear wheel
[31:57] drive. So, that is a 160 kW electric motor in the rear and nothing in the front. Then you get to the preferred
[32:03] all-wheel drive, which is what we have here today, plus a package. But mechanically, this is a preferred all-wheel drive. It has a 70 kW e- motor
[32:11] in the front and then a 160 in the rear. The horsepower is 303 and then the
[32:16] torque is 446 pound- feet of torque. If you want even more horsepower, there is
[32:22] the dual or all-wheel drive setup that has the 160 in the front and also 160 in
[32:28] the rear. Someone asked if I have two-tone nail polish. Thank you guys for noticing.
[32:34] It's Yeah, it's one of those color changing colors. It's pretty cool. Just
[32:40] like the paint, actually. So, even when I don't match the car with my clothes, I kind of match it with
[32:46] something, right? Um,
[32:54] have you heard any news about the electric van? Nails are rocking. Nothing. Nothing official yet. No, no,
[33:00] no. Um, how much faster is the 10 to 80% charging time for the Ioni 9 with its top tier battery management compared to
[33:06] its rivals? So, its closest rival would be the Kia EV6 and they're about the same, but they are also based on the
[33:13] same architecture. So, that 4800 volt. You do have a larger battery pack with
[33:18] this vehicle. So, it's going to be slightly larger. I believe the EV9 on a 350 kW charger is about 20 minutes where
[33:26] this vehicle is 24. So, it it's very marginal. Over that, I wouldn't pick one or the other. It would really have to be
[33:32] based off availability and my personal preference. I wouldn't do it off the actual charge times because there won't
[33:38] really be different. If you are level two or home charging this vehicle, it is
[33:43] about 10 hours. So, it's actually I think it's well, off the top of my head,
[33:48] I don't remember the exact minutes, but it's going to be about 10 hours or overnight. And keep in mind that is from
[33:53] 10 to 100%. So, there's a good chance you might not be dropping your vehicle down to 10 every single day. Maybe you
[34:00] are. That's the case, good on you for using your car. you bought the car, you're using it. But if you are, let's
[34:05] say, just going down to 60% charge and the next day would probably be 40 based off your driving. You don't have to
[34:11] charge it every single day. Um, any big questions?
[34:17] I don't see anything too too much that's popping out.
[34:22] Um, DT said, "The nails are pearlescent color that changes with the light." Yes, just like this paint. I will say the
[34:29] paint name again. So, it's Celadon Gray. I think that's the correct way to
[34:35] pronounce it. Celadon, but again, it does not look like how Hyundai displays it on their website.
[34:41] But let me know what you guys think about it. I do think it's gorgeous. I really do love a paint that changes. Anything that has depth and dimension
[34:48] and just looks different. Love it. Absolutely love it. Um, we did get asked about the range. So, it's 515 km of all
[34:55] electric range and pretty cool. Every model of the Ioni 9 is either 500 or
[35:00] more kilometers. So, the rated range is higher than its sister car, the Kia EV9,
[35:06] which the highest range is only 491. Pretty cool. All right, you guys. Thank
[35:12] you so so much for watching. We hope to see you again in tomorrow's live stream video, which will be at 2 p.m. Eastern
[35:18] Standard Time. If there's any questions we didn't get to get to during the stream itself, let us know in the
[35:23] comments down below because I check them every single day. That is my main social media source. Anyway, take care.
