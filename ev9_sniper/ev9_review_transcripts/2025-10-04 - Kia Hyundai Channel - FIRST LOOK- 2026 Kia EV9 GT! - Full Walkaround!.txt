[00:00] always crave the feeling of driving a vehicle, hitting the gas pedal, and being launched into the back of your
[00:05] seat. Let me tell you, you can get that feeling for the whole family. For the first time ever, we have the 2026 Kia
[00:12] EV9 GT. And this is no GT line. This is no land all-wheel drive regular trim
[00:18] level. This is a full GT. So, you may have heard of this in the past with the Kia EV6. Well, that vehicle has been
[00:25] discontinued because they thought, why not make the fun for the whole family? It's a pretty cool car. Today's video,
[00:31] we're doing a full in-depth walkthrough of everything you get in this particular trim level, but we're also going to highlight the big changes because I
[00:38] mean, from the outside, minus the lime green accents, it looks a lot like your regular EV9. But performance-wise, there
[00:44] are very, very big differences. And the purpose why we're doing this live is so that you can ask us questions in real
[00:50] time. And I want to see how you guys feel about this car. It is drastically different. And I'm going to start right
[00:55] off the bat by saying it's also very expensive. It's the most expensive vehicle in Kia's lineup. So, I want to
[01:00] hear what you guys have to say about that. What do you think? I mentioned it's expensive, so I might as well tell you the price point. It is 85295
[01:09] Canadian. That is almost $100,000. But let me say, if you're just shopping for a three row all SUV, almost all the
[01:17] competitors are well over $100,000 and they are not at this performance level. Or maybe they can be, but it's going to
[01:24] be way way way way more money. So, let's get into it. Without further ado, we're starting off with the exterior
[01:29] walkthrough, then we'll work our way inside with a brief Q&A at the end of the video. Let's get into it. So, I've
[01:35] already got our lighting system on, and the GT actually changes the digital lighting elements of the typical EV9.
[01:41] So, you still have those LED lights working their way into the grill, but you'll notice the design that they follow is slightly different. And just
[01:48] like the EV9 of the past, there is the option to customize this, too. It is a feature on demand, so a subscription
[01:54] level feature. So, you can opt in or opt out. But either way, the stock lights look fantastic. The full headlamp unit
[02:01] is again a bright white LED with very vertical and angular styling points,
[02:07] giving this car a lot of aggressive styling elements. Now, the front end doesn't look too too different in terms
[02:13] of what makes a GT different than the other trim levels, but there are some slight cues, and maybe if you're a Kia
[02:19] nerd like me, you'll notice them. If not, I'll point them out anyway. So, the active air shutters on this vehicle now
[02:25] have a vertical design sequence to them. Small, but makes a little bit of a
[02:30] difference. And then you'll notice lots of gloss black. In terms of safety and tech, we have all of the functions that
[02:36] were available on the GT line trim level. So, things like our forward- facing parking sensors, our front view
[02:42] camera, great automated functions like highway driving assist level two, which
[02:47] again monitors your speed from the car ahead of you, but also does its own automated lane changes. So, in terms of
[02:53] tech and safety, you're not losing anything with the GT. You're just getting a big performance boost. I think
[02:58] we should talk about the performance next. And it only feels natural if we pop the hood while doing it. Call me
[03:04] crazy, but this is what we do on our gas cars. Might as well do it on our electric cars, too. In terms of the
[03:10] battery pack, we still have that 99.8 kW lithium ion polymer battery, except our
[03:18] motor sizes have changed. So up at the front we have an 160 kW electric motor.
[03:25] And then in the rear we have a 270 kW electric motor. So much larger in the
[03:31] rear. For horsepower, we're working with 52 horses. Actually, I guess it's
[03:37] technically less. If anyone knows the actual conversion rate of how much horses go into one horsepower, we can
[03:43] work that out in the comments down below. But off the top of my head, I do not have that computer. That calculation is not in my reservoir there. For
[03:51] torque, we have 545 pound- feet of torque. And that horsepower boost is 123
[03:57] more horsepowers than the GT line trim level below it. So, pretty big boost over there. If you are looking at the
[04:03] 100 to 60, so sorry 0 to 100 specs, it is 4.6 seconds. And of course, that is
[04:09] 100 kilometers per hour, not miles per hour. So, this thing goes and it goes instantly. If you've never driven an
[04:15] electric car before, the difference is very, very drastic. If you hit the gas pedal, there's no turbo lag. There's no
[04:22] buildup in power. It is absolutely instant, and it's available right the second you hit the gas. However, this
[04:28] car has introduced something a little bit different called e-shift. Now, I'll probably talk more about this when we
[04:34] hop inside, but it's not exactly new to the Kia Hyundai channel because we first saw it on the Hyundai Ionic 5N. It's
[04:41] essentially a simulated gearshift simulation. So, this vehicle will feel
[04:47] like an 8-speed dual clutch transmission just like what we have in cars like the Elantre N, the Kona N, and the Veloster
[04:52] N. It is extremely cool and very engaging to drive. Now, let's go back to
[04:57] the exterior elements with their wheels. So, we have a 21in alloy that is exclusive in its design for the GT trim
[05:05] level. features gloss black elements with sharp razor blade style spokes. I
[05:11] absolutely love this wheel design. I like how they meant I mean they were purposeful in creating a lot of open
[05:18] spoke area. So you could see those giant lime green brake calipers. So they are
[05:24] monlock style brake caliper. Very bright. You do have GT badging. Unfortunately, the spoke is conveniently
[05:30] blocking it with a 20in rotor in the front and a 19in rotor in the rear.
[05:36] They're ventilated for both front and rear, too, giving you great stopping power. Because with the 0 to 100 of 4.6
[05:42] seconds, you're going to need to stop at some point, and you'll probably need to stop quickly. So, don't worry. It's not
[05:48] just the horsepower we got. We got the braking power, too. For your tires, they're a high performance Continental
[05:54] tire. Check them out. They're the sport contact six. Very nice. All right. I do
[06:00] also want to mention that this vehicle does have all-wheel drive seeing it is both a rear and front motor system.
[06:06] Again, larger motor in the rear. However, it does come with terrain modes. So, snow, mud, and sand. All of
[06:13] which will change the torque distribution for the vehicle and the stability control too. Give you a little bit better handling in said conditions.
[06:20] Vehicle like this is also going to be extremely heavy. I mean, no surprise there. giving it a very planted feel in
[06:26] snowy commutes or slushy commutes. Now, that being said, I always like to mention if this is your first winter
[06:32] driving electric vehicle, whether it's rear wheel drive, front-wheel drive, or all-wheel drive like this, you will have
[06:37] to take into consideration that there is more torque in this vehicle or more so instant torque. So, with things like
[06:43] slippery conditions, just be careful with how much throttle you are giving your car. Any sort of instant power
[06:49] change can create sliding and slip. So, just take that into consideration. That being said, it's still great to drive in
[06:56] the snow. You just have to change the way you drive a little bit. For more styling elements, surrounding our wheel
[07:01] arch, you'll notice it's gloss black and on a white paint like we have here today creates a beautiful element of contrast.
[07:08] Those gloss black elements also work their way into our mirrors, which of course are power folding and electronically controlled while also
[07:14] being heated. There's an LED turn signal indicator mounted on the front side of our mirror with our blind view
[07:21] monitoring cameras. These cameras that we find surrounding the outside of our vehicle, all have a very high quality
[07:27] feed. So, when you are inside, you can see exactly what's happening around your car, whether you're indicating a lane
[07:32] change or parking your vehicle. That being said, it's a pretty big vehicle, which can be intimidating to park. But
[07:38] these extra assistances definitely make it a little bit easier or at least help you double check to make sure you know
[07:44] you're not hitting anything and we are in between the lines. For your door handles, they are our power folding
[07:50] style or power hiding style. So, they retract and go completely flush with the vehicle for aerodynamics while driving
[07:56] or of course while the vehicle is locked and then pop out for easy convenience to get in and out of your car. Small
[08:02] difference that the GT gets you is the low profile roof rails. You may or may not have
[08:09] noticed the difference, but of course with a car like this, aerodynamics are important. Let's make it as smooth and
[08:16] slippery as possible. Speaking of the regular EV9 has the same drag coefficient as a C8 Corvette and they
[08:22] have very different bodies. You look at a Corvette and think, "Wow, sports car, it's got to be aerodynamic." You look at
[08:28] this and think rectangle wheels can't be aerodynamic. Maybe if it was a Jeep
[08:33] Wrangler, but this is aerodynamic, believe it or not. It's also got a very, very low center of gravity, making its
[08:39] handling quite great considering it is a giant SUV. Now, will this handle like
[08:45] the EV6 GT? No, it is a larger car. It's a taller car and it's a six-seater electric car. It's going to feel a
[08:52] little bit heavier. It's going to feel a bit bigger because it is bigger. So, let's not forget at the end of the day, it is still a three row SUV, but it goes
[08:59] really fast and it's got some pretty cool performance functions, which we'll talk about more later. For things that
[09:05] are mechanically different, we have an electronically controlled suspension. So, this has two different preview
[09:11] modes. one of which will see what kind of driving you're doing and if you hit something like a speed bump or some sort
[09:16] of obstacle, it automatically adjusts to give you smoother handling over it. So, it is supposed to have more off-road
[09:22] enhanced capability, but also for things like highway, just creating an overall more smooth vehicle, so less roll. So,
[09:29] two different modes, the car will automatically adjust. You can also go into the vehicle's drive mode settings
[09:34] and change your suspension to be more on the sporty side. I'll show you guys that when we do hop in the car, though. You
[09:40] also have an electronically controlled limited slip differential. And the additions of both of these functions
[09:45] removes the self-levelizing rear suspension that the GT line trim level of the EV9 had. So, we no longer
[09:52] have the selfleizing. We now have the electronically controlled. Pretty cool. Still great
[09:58] functions like our power release. This has a proximity function that allows you to simply walk up to the back of your
[10:04] car and have it automatically open or you can press it like I just did and it does it itself. It is height adjustable,
[10:10] so whatever setting you'd like it to be by pressing and holding this button here will save it. Now, in terms of space,
[10:16] it's going to be exactly the same as the regular EV9. So, it's a six-seater configuration. Two seats in the rear,
[10:23] two in the middle, and two, of course, up at the very front. All of the seats will be power controlled in terms of
[10:28] folding or unfolding the seats with the buttons to do so being located on the right hand side of the cargo area.
[10:35] They're individually controlled. So, if you only want, let's say, the left side down, just go ahead and press the left
[10:41] side, and they'll work their way down nice and slow. But hey, it's doing it by itself, so you don't have to worry about
[10:47] running around to the side and bringing them back up. You can also powerfold your seats from the vehicle's head unit.
[10:53] So, if I was driving and I know, let's say I'm going to IKEA and they're loading my things in for me, I can go
[10:59] ahead and knock everything down from my driver's seat. I don't have to come around and move. So, it's pretty convenient in that sense. You get your
[11:05] level one charger, of course, with every new electric vehicle. This level one charger is certainly not
[11:12] the best way to charge your car, but it comes with the vehicle, and it's easy to toot around with. It's portable. This
[11:18] will take a matter of days to charge your vehicle from empty. So that's why it's definitely not the most preferred way of charging. But let's say you're
[11:24] going away for a long weekend to somebody's cottage, somebody's house, and they don't have a proper EV charger.
[11:30] You can leave your vehicle parked there for a few days with this plugged in, and you will get substantial or full amount
[11:35] of charge. Now, for actual charging, this vehicle has our North American charging standard port, or I like to
[11:42] call it the Knack port. It's on the other side. I get confused sometimes.
[11:47] And it essentially can take your vehicle from 10 to 80% in 24 minutes when you're
[11:53] equipped on a 350 kW charger. So very fast charging is equipped on the Kia
[12:00] EV9. Seeing as it is on our 800vt charging infrastructure, also called our
[12:05] EGMP, electric global modular platform. It's trademarked. I'm going to close
[12:10] that up. Um but before I do so, actually, I'll show you guys the lighting. So, number one, we do have a light there just to illuminate the port.
[12:17] So, if you are plugging in your vehicle at night time, you can actually see what you're doing. And then this light over here is the charge, state of charge
[12:24] indicator. So, seeing as it's fully illuminated, we have a full charge. If it was about halfway, it would be a half
[12:29] charge. Going to close that up, though, and we'll take a look at the rear with the liftgate closed down. The lighting
[12:37] sequence on the EV9 has always been beautiful in my opinion. I'm happy they went with the classic look again for the
[12:42] GT. They didn't change it. So, sharp lighting on the tail lamps just like what we had for our headlamps up at the
[12:48] front. Full LEDs, of course. So, bold, bright, and we also have our high-mounted brake lights integrated
[12:55] into the spoiler. With the spoiler, it's also going to house this camera here. This is utilized for your digital rear
[13:02] view monitor. And then we have our rear wiper tucked away underneath so it's out of sight for, you know, things like snow
[13:09] and ice that won't build up on your wipers. You'll get your rear parking sensors. Very handy for parking garages,
[13:16] tight spaces, because this will give you an audible alert inside the cabin. And then we have our regular backup camera
[13:23] just below our trunk lid. Your reverse lights also integrated into the tail
[13:30] light design itself. You got some reflectors along the bottom and then a little bit of a gunmetal finish
[13:36] surrounding your rear bumper. Absolutely beautiful. The design is classic in my
[13:41] opinion. I know some people like to think EVs are ugly with their styling because they go in a crazy crazy
[13:49] different look. I do think this is still fairly traditional. And in my opinion, although the Ionic 9 is the direct
[13:55] competitor, they are on the same platform, same size roughly. I like this design better. It's my my favorite in my
[14:02] opinion, but again, opinions are everyone's got one. Anyway, the right hand side is where you'll get your GT
[14:07] badge. So, like I mentioned earlier, there's not too too much in terms of the exterior styling that makes this vehicle
[14:14] stand out. It's truly just the lime calipers that really really pop and then
[14:19] the slight GT badging. The inside though, that's where it changes. So, before I hop in, I'll have Adam take a
[14:26] quick look and check out these seats. These seats are incredible. So you get a
[14:32] beautiful mix of suede and leatherrett with a lot but a lot tastefully of lime
[14:38] green accents. So that's the piping throughout the seat but also the stitching surrounding. Up at the top you
[14:45] have a little bit of this metal design for your upper seat back. This doesn't get in the way of your comfort. You're
[14:51] not pressing your body up against this but it does look quite nice. And then GT badging in the headrest. The headrest
[14:58] also still carries over that intricate lime green detailing with the stitching.
[15:04] The steering wheel is my absolute favorite. So, it's the same shape as the regular EV9's wheel, except
[15:11] that's how we know it's a race car. There we go. Just like a GT3 RS, guys, we got it. We also have a dedicated GT
[15:19] button. I'll explain that in a few minutes, but just certainly more sporty elements for the interior styling. Now,
[15:26] one thing I will say, the Kia EV6 GT was our first performance electric vehicle.
[15:32] It was great. It was a ton of fun to drive, but the seats, depending on who you were, they could be a nightmare. If
[15:38] you were someone who is small and the bolster wasn't digging into your side, yeah, you can make a long road trip out of it. But those seats were extremely
[15:45] stiff and they were ma manual seats. So, no power adjustments. They were only heated. That was it. The seat was the
[15:51] seat and you sat in it. That was all. This seat, you'll notice, has a ton of
[15:56] adjustments. And it's not just power adjustments to get you in a good position. It's also a massage seat. It's
[16:04] got an erggo motion function. So, no more bad back. It's heated. It's ventilated. And it's massaging. You got
[16:11] your driver knee extender, which of course is powered. Your regular height adjustment with the tilt function, too.
[16:18] Back rest. An adjustment for the bolstering itself. So, if you do feel like it's too snug on you, you can
[16:23] release it a little bit. And then four-way lumbar supports. This is also a memory seat. So, if you are a family
[16:30] that has multiple drivers, you can set your driver seat settings through the
[16:35] buttons here. That will also sync your steering wheel adjustments because it is a power adjustable steering wheel and
[16:42] your mirrors, too. So, all those will be synced to your driver memory seat button. Very, very handy. Speaking of
[16:48] which, this is quite different than the Kia EV6. We have our heated seat and ventilated seat controls on the door
[16:54] card itself with our heated steering wheel and massage seat function also being here. So, everything seat or just
[17:01] driver comfort wise is all within the driver's reach at all times. It'll also illuminate to let you know, let me turn
[17:07] the car on first. That'll probably help. It illuminates to let you know what level you've had it set to with blue
[17:12] being ventilation and this orange being the heat function. As far as material goes for the inside,
[17:19] you'll notice we have quite a bit of this suede mix. So, we have it in a few
[17:24] inserts along the door card, but we'll also find it within the dash and of course the seat itself. The Meridian
[17:30] premium sound system has a gunmetal finish to the door. And then the door itself is a light gray. So, this
[17:37] material or this interior of the car isn't too dark, especially considering I mean there's a lot of dark elements, but
[17:43] it's mixed tones. Our lights just went out. So, Adam's going to go get them back on. And while he does that, I'll
[17:49] take you guys on a tour of the steering wheel and then our gauge cluster. So,
[17:54] like I mentioned earlier, beautiful steering wheel. Ergonomic, it's heated, and you got your racing stripe. We also
[18:01] have our GT mode. Now, when you press this, it'll put its ve the vehicle in full power mode. So, this is going to be
[18:08] where you'll have everything in pure pure sport mode. It's going to turn off your traction control and your stability
[18:14] control. It'll change your gauge cluster dials. So, you can see over here we have our range, our kilometers per hour, and
[18:22] then if it lets me zoom in, my steering setting, my suspension setting setting, and my battery setting or power setting.
[18:30] So, very, very cool. Up above, you can see our heads up display just like what
[18:35] we had on last year's GT Line. Your speed's projected. Same thing with the speed limit. And if you are actively
[18:41] driving on a road, it'll show you when there's a car in your blind spot, etc., etc. GT mode looks like a ton of fun. I
[18:47] haven't driven this car yet, so I can't speak on it, but this this looks awesome. I'm very happy it looks
[18:54] different than our regular sport display cluster. Speaking of regular sport displays, do not worry. We still have
[18:59] our traditional drive and terrain mode selections, both being on the steering wheel. So, by pressing our buttons,
[19:05] you'll see we got eco, normal, and sport mode. Sport mode will just be a slightly dialed down version of GT mode. So, your
[19:12] stability and traction control will still remain on, but you will have everything else set to sport. Terrain
[19:19] modes are snow, mud, and sand, like I mentioned earlier, just giving you better stability in those conditions.
[19:24] Then on the lefth hand side, we'll notice our smart cruise control, which automatically turns into highway driving
[19:29] assist if you are on the highway. Our distance control, so that will change the following distance. our steering
[19:35] assistance. If you give that a press, you'll get an icon appear right over there. That also show that our system is
[19:41] on. This notepad button lets you change what's displayed on the gauge cluster. So, right now, we have our performance
[19:47] timer, which is exclusive to the GT trim. You can also see your directional control through compass or your
[19:53] all-wheel drive torque distribution, lane assistance, tire pressure, whatever you'd like to see. There is a screen for it, which is quite cool. Right hand side
[20:00] is media controls, which is pretty standard. We'll save that for a future video where we go off all the nitty-gritty stuff. You guys probably
[20:06] want to know more about the performance aspects. So, I'm going to invite Adam to come over to the passenger side and he
[20:12] will take over filming in just a second, but I'm going to mention our e-shift first. So, I told you guys earlier that
[20:19] it was first introduced on Hyundai's Ioni 5N. And essentially, it is a simulated gearshift experience. So, the
[20:26] most common complaint with electric cars, especially on a performance standpoint, is that they feel boring. They feel soulless. There's no noise.
[20:33] There's no real difference in feel. Because if you think about it, if you're driving a gas car and let's say you're
[20:39] driving it hard, you're driving on the track. Your eyes, your ears, everything is all in tune with the vehicle. You're
[20:44] getting constant adjustments. It's not just it's not just steering wheel and gas pedal. That's not the only thing
[20:49] you're doing. You're listening. You're hearing these changes. You're feeling these changes. You're hearing your car needing to go to the next gear. You're
[20:55] changing that gear. That's not the case on this car. It's a zero reduction gear. there's no no gears. So, this changes
[21:02] that. So, if I am operating in e-shift, I will feel my vehicle start to almost
[21:08] bog out if it's time for me to go to my next gear. And I'm going to use the paddle shifters on my vehicle, the left
[21:14] one being to downshift, my right one being to upshift, just like a gas car, and change the gears on my electric car
[21:21] that has no gears. So, again, it is a synthetic experience, but it really does change the feel of the car. And the way
[21:28] it's doing that is it's using this artificial gear mapping system. So it's kind of limiting the amount of power
[21:34] that's available at certain points. So if I'm nearing the end of my gear, it's going to kind of bog out. It's going to
[21:40] give a little bit of regen braking to slow me down a little bit, indicating that I need to upshift and then we get a
[21:46] full power band again. You know what I mean? So we're working through those gears even without them. It's all computerized, which makes it feel like a
[21:53] gimmick, but it doesn't feel like a gimmick when you're actually driving. That's what makes it so much fun. You
[21:58] can turn this on or off. It's not available in eco mode, but it is available in normal sport and of course GT mode. This also pumps out some
[22:05] artificial noise, too. So, I will say it's not corny noise. It doesn't sound like
[22:12] it is artificial engine noise. So, that audible feedback does make a difference, too. Feels like you're driving a car.
[22:18] Again, I will uh show you guys what I mean. So, let's put the vehicle into
[22:24] sport mode. And I think I left it on. I didn't leave it on. Sorry, guys. I'm new
[22:29] here. Let's turn it on. On and do it. So, one
[22:34] thing that I always forget that I can do whenever we film an electric vehicle is turn it on fully because of course we
[22:39] can't do that with a gas car. So, now that we're in a EV, we can fully turn it on. I probably have to close the hood or
[22:46] else it won't let me do it. So, bear with me one second while I do so. So far, I hope you guys can see that
[22:52] this vehicle has definitely improved in terms of the comfort of our electric vehicles because the EV6 of the past had
[23:01] all the performance, but there was quite a bit of tradeoff. There was a little bit of downside in terms of comfort, but
[23:08] you were still paying a lot of money for a car. So, now we have those very comfortable seats. We have all those
[23:13] comfort functions like the power folding, the massage function, the ventilation, and we have the
[23:18] performance, too. So, it's pretty cool. All right. Now that the car can technically actually drive, let's make
[23:25] sure our e-shift is on. So, we'll go to setup over here on the vehicle. Then,
[23:30] we'll go to vehicle and then I believe it's under drive mode.
[23:36] Might there we go. VGS. So, virtual gear shift. I don't know if you guys could hear that change in noise. I can hear
[23:43] it. But I'm going to show you how to redline an EV. Mash the gas pedal.
[23:54] It's redlined. Pretty cool. Put it in GT mode. It should be a little bit more amplified.
[24:00] Yeah. So, it actually goes to a higher RPM now. Pretty cool. That is your shift indicator bar. So, on some more modern
[24:08] vehicles, performance vehicles I should say, they'll usually have some sort of illumination like that indicating when
[24:13] it is time to shift. So, this car will have it as well, too. If I were to actually be driving and I'm in manually
[24:19] shift mode or manual shift mode, it'll be on full red if it's time for me to upshift and it'll also bog the car out a
[24:25] little bit. So, I won't be able to accelerate as easy. Again, this can be turned off if you're not a fan of it. In
[24:31] terms of what else we can change, let's go back to our custom drive mode. And here we can play around with both the
[24:38] motor, the steering response, suspension. So, of course, sport plus
[24:43] will be a bit stiffer, but great for, you know, more dynamic driving, stability control, and then the
[24:49] electronic limited slip differential, too. So, I can make it all on sport plus or sport mode. So, that way anytime I go
[24:56] to my custom drive, it's set up to exactly the way I'd like it. Very, very customizable. Another great thing is
[25:02] because this vehicle does have driver profiles found over here. Right now, we're in guest, but if this is my
[25:08] personal vehicle, I would set up my own. These will all be synced to my select profile. So, if my partner was taking
[25:15] the car out one day and they have completely different tastes and, you know, seating situations, music situations, and driver feel, it's all
[25:23] synced to our separate accounts, which is extremely handy. But the rest of the layout of the vehicle, very much regular
[25:29] EV9 layout. I said layout, not materials, because materials are different. So, this crash pad here,
[25:35] which is our haptic buttons, does have a different material. I don't know exactly what to call this. It's almost like a
[25:41] like a stone material. It's pretty cool. It is back lit, too. So, at night time, you can see the buttons that are here.
[25:48] Your touchscreen display is a 12.3 in fully touchscreen with their new software that has wireless Apple CarPlay
[25:55] and Android Auto and over the air updates. You get your separate climate control menu here, which you can expand
[26:02] to cover up the full screen. You can go and manually adjust your rear climate or lock it if your kids are
[26:09] misbehaving. And then we have a little bit of ambient lighting right behind the suede panel with the dedicated GT badge
[26:17] more towards the passenger side. So, a slight difference in interior materials for sure, giving the cabin a very moody
[26:24] and sporty feel. The ambient lighting is two-tone, so you can have the upstairs area one color and the downstairs
[26:30] separate. Totally up to you. You can link it to the driver mode, too. So, whatever your preference is, you can
[26:35] customize it because there's a full color wheel. The passenger seat we didn't talk about yet, so I'm going to have Adam hop out while I point out the
[26:42] adjustments. The bolstering is not adjustable on the passenger seat, but you do have lumbar support as well as
[26:49] the back of the seat. So, your back rest adjustment and then our height
[26:54] adjustment with the tilt. The seat is also heated and ventilated with the controls being mounted on the door card
[27:00] just like the driver. All righty. Now, I think we should take a look at the second and third rows
[27:06] because at the end of the day, this is a family performance SUV. Fun for the whole family.
[27:19] Forgot this was powered. Hello.
[27:25] Perfect. Okay, so these two captain's chairs here, they have that same lime
[27:31] green. I was about to say acid green, but lime green piping throughout the very middle. They're heated and
[27:37] ventilated, and they do have a VIP lounge function. So, if I would like to recline these seats and get almost a
[27:43] zero gravity feel, I absolutely can do so. If I were to hop in these middle seats,
[27:51] can adjust myself manually to get to where I like, we do have our armrest
[27:58] adjustments. The heat and ventilation is right over here. Now, I don't know if I said that they were powered. They are
[28:03] not powered, but you can still maneuver them to however you like best. They are on a rail, so if I need to move my seat
[28:09] upwards to give the people in the third row a little bit more room, I can do so very, very easily. Although these seats
[28:16] are very wide and comfy, they're not heavy. So, if you do have smaller children that could be moving these
[28:21] seats, it's not hard to do so. I know some seats in the past were. You got to put a little bit of work into them.
[28:27] these ones. Very easy to get into the third row. You do have a button on the shoulder area of both captain's chairs.
[28:35] Pressing that will make the seat fold forward and release it on its rail. So, you can easily push it and walk into the
[28:41] third row with no problems. Before we do that though, there's a couple more things I'd like to highlight,
[28:48] and that is the fact that in our second row, we have our air vents up at the top.
[28:54] So, if you do have little ones in car seats, they'll be getting into wherever you need to go quickly, but they'll also
[28:59] have air flow directly towards them. There is a climate control panel here, too, where you can set the exact
[29:04] temperature as well as the fan speed or completely shut it off. And like I mentioned earlier, it is lockable from
[29:10] the front. So, you can set it to your preference at the front and lock it so they can't change it. The backs of the
[29:17] seats ahead of us have a little bit of ambient lighting, which I think is absolutely beautiful and a very nice
[29:22] touch. The backings are also suede over here. So, very premium material. It feels great, but it doesn't show
[29:29] fingerprints that easy because it is so dark. Terms of cleaning it, I don't know how that's going to go. Make sure you
[29:36] tell your kids don't touch. The backs also have our plastic style pocket and
[29:43] then builtin USBC's. These are 100 watt USBCs, so very fast charging. Cup
[29:49] holders are mounted on the back of the center console. Little bit of ambient lighting on the bottom with our slide
[29:55] out either tray or storage cubby if you push it in. There we go. It is felt
[30:02] lined now, too. So, if you put anything there and it rolls around as you're driving, it won't be as noisy because
[30:07] it's not hitting plastic. It has that felt liner to make things a little bit more insulated, which is very nice. Nice
[30:13] touch. Now, I'll quickly sit in the third row and show you guys space. To do so, again, I'm just going to quickly
[30:18] press that button. That'll fold my seat and let it slide. All right, we got one seat down. Why do
[30:25] I do this to myself? It was me. Okay, third row left. There we go. It's nice
[30:30] that it's power folding again. Here's the window sticker. So, like I mentioned, the price is 85 to 95
[30:37] Canadian. That is the MSRP. So, before taxes and fees, tax and fees of course
[30:43] will vary based off which province you're in. And that is the Canadian pricing. If y'all are watching from the States, your vehicle could be equipped
[30:49] differently and it'll definitely be priced differently. Definitely. Right now, I'm going to sit behind this seat
[30:55] here, which is which is reclined almost all the way.
[31:00] So, my knees are technically touching right now. Now, hopefully the person sitting in front of me wouldn't be so
[31:05] rude and would straighten their seat up a little bit and then I would have a ton of space. In terms of headroom, I have a
[31:11] lot of it so my hand can go completely upright over my head. I do have air vents right over me and LED lighting.
[31:21] It works good. On the sides, and this is repeated on my side, of course, we do have adjustments to our seat. So, if I'd
[31:28] like to recline my seat a little bit, I can. Or if I want to move it more upright, I also can. There are two
[31:34] USBC's, one on either side, and that is again a 100 kilow or 100 watt USBC, and
[31:40] two cup holders on either side. Your speaker system also extends back here. So, whatever music you're listening to
[31:47] or podcast media, it'll be extended back here with no problem and crystal clear
[31:53] audio. Now, your windows back here are also quite large. So, that is one major flaw of most third rows. They give you a
[31:59] tiny tiny window and you're sitting back here and you don't even feel like you're a part of the car anymore. This allows you to maybe if you're not joined in on
[32:06] the conversation, you can look out the window and dissociate like me. But it is a very comfy third row if whoever was
[32:14] sitting here last wasn't so rude. Okay, I'm gonna hop out you guys and answer some questions. Again, this wasn't a
[32:20] very in-depth in-depth walkthrough. We just got this car. I haven't even driven it yet. We'll probably do one a very
[32:27] like tech focused or full in-depth performance review very soon. We got to get driving it first. Let's go see what
[32:33] you guys have to say in the comments.
[32:39] Also, I don't know if I mentioned the rated range. We have 418 kilometers of rated range on this vehicle, which is
[32:45] quite good considering the trim level below is at about 450.
[32:52] I'm going to go get some water, you guys.
[33:01] I was about to choke. Did you miss me? All right, let's see what you guys have to say. What is the miles range on this?
[33:08] miles. Adam, do you want to do the conversion? It's 418 kilometers. All right,
[33:13] Adam is on it. Um, acquiring the Nurero EV or standard EV9 would be fine for me. Yeah, so most
[33:20] people the regular EV9 would be fine, but if you are someone who wants a performance oriented version, we have
[33:26] that now. Adam, what what was the conversion? 259.73 miles.
[33:31] Two just under 260 miles. Um,
[33:37] isn't it strange to have a three row SUV be so powerful instead of a sedan? It is a little bit strange, but I think we
[33:42] also have to take into account that no one's buying sedans in Canada. Unfortunately, majority of our customers
[33:49] are looking for crossovers or SUVs. So, it makes more sense.
[33:54] This car doesn't make sense, but it also makes sense at the same time because I see the price point and I think, "Oh my
[34:00] goodness, that's an expensive car." But then I realize if someone wants an all electric three row SUV, if they're not
[34:08] buying the Kia or the Hyundai, they're spending well over $100,000. So getting one with this much
[34:13] performance, this much features, looks this good for under that price. Not bad.
[34:19] Not bad. And again, if you're not after the performance variant, there are so many trim levels of the Kia EV9. I'm
[34:24] sure there's one you can find that works for your family. There is a premium trim level, a GT line trim level, which gives
[34:31] you the sporty accents, but it's not quite exactly as hardcore as this one. There's so many options. A lot of
[34:38] birthday wishes, you guys. Thank you so so much. I really appreciate it. You guys made my day very, very special. And
[34:43] it's carrying over into the next week. So, feel like it's going to be a great week.
[34:48] Oh my goodness. Yeah, Ruthless Biscuit, thank you so so much. You guys are absolutely the best. Thank you. Thank
[34:54] you for your support. And thank you, Ruthless. You're always on. You're always supporting. We show the love.
[34:59] Thank you, Maserborn. I love that little emoji thing that you commented. It's like a the whale, the smiling whale. I
[35:05] love it. Um, is there any chance we get a Tucson N? Not the Nline, but an actual N. I'm
[35:12] going to probably say no. I don't think it'll come to fruition. If anything,
[35:17] maybe they'll do another Kona N, but even that, we haven't gotten official confirmation, so I can't say for sure.
[35:25] Um, we did get asked if we need a thumbnail designer, videovide video editor. That's what Adam does. So, Adam,
[35:31] you're fired. I'm joking. I'm joking. Uh, no, we got Adam, but thank you.
[35:38] Um, Udin said, "You can buy a house in Michigan for 80 or 90K,
[35:46] or you could buy an EV9 in Brford." Hey, you can't drive your house, but you
[35:52] can live in your car. Also, Samarth noticed if I'm back. I do notice notice that he's back. I did notice.
[35:59] Can you do a test drive of the car? Yes. So, that is in the works. We will be doing a nighttime drive with the EV9 GT
[36:06] that is. And with that, we'll also include the test drive, too.
[36:11] Um, what is the estimated all-electric range for the EV9 GT? And how does it compare or how does the increased power
[36:17] impact its range compared to the standard EV9 trims? So, this vehicle is rated at 418 kilometers of all electric
[36:23] range, and the trim level below is roughly 450. So, yes, there is a range decrease. It's not drastic in my
[36:29] opinion. It's certainly not quite as big as the EV6 GT compared to the other EV6
[36:35] trim levels. Do you need to get that car out, the
[36:40] Lotus? Just go for it. Now, of course, one thing with a vehicle like the EV9
[36:46] GT, you can get the artificial noise inside, but you're not really getting that artificial or just noise period on
[36:52] the outside. At low speeds, electric vehicles are required to emit a noise, a
[36:58] warning noise, so pedestrians nearby can hear the vehicle. But it's not going to sound like this guy over here.
[37:06] Impeccable segue.
[37:12] And to some that is okay. Now I will say back on my topic earlier, my little
[37:18] rant, having that artificial gear shift feeling and the noise too really changes
[37:24] the experience because I know for me I always thought EVs were really cool. I love being able to hit the gas and fly.
[37:30] But even though I'm going so quickly, sometimes it doesn't feel like you're driving that fast. It doesn't feel like
[37:35] you're going that quickly because you're not getting those other cues. You, you know, you're not getting those sound cues. you're not really getting those
[37:41] feel cues. You see everything moving past you really quickly, but you're not feeling the car too too much. So, I
[37:49] think integrating things like this, they don't feel like gimmicks. They actually really change the driving experience,
[37:54] and I'm willing to fight anyone on that. Even Jeremy Clarkson agreed that this is awesome, and he hates everything. So,
[38:02] I'll say it, you guys. This is a pretty wicked car. I can't wait to film a video about the drive. Till then though, this
[38:08] video is at 38 minutes, so we should probably end it off. I'd like to thank you guys so so much for joining on. Huh?
[38:16] Oh my gosh, Magic Born. Thank you. Thank you so much. That is You guys, y'all,
[38:24] y'all throw me off topic. I would like to thank you guys both, Ruthless Biscuit and Mazerborn. Y'all are the best. Take
[38:31] care. Brush your hair and we'll see you in tomorrow's video. I'm out of breath. I'm also
[38:37] flabbergasted. Thank you guys. You guys are the best.
