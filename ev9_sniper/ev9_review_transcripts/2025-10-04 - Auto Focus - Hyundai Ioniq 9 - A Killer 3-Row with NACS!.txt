[00:00] It really feels like not that long ago
[00:02] when we first started having EVs come
[00:04] out, every single new one got compared
[00:06] to Tesla, whether they deserve to or
[00:08] not, because there weren't that many
[00:10] electric options. Now, there's some like
[00:14] tons of options in every single segment.
[00:15] So, if you specifically want a three row
[00:19] fully electric SUV, well, you can get
[00:21] the Catalike Escalade or the EQS or the
[00:24] Rivian R1S or the Kia EV9.
[00:29] But this one right here, I think stands
[00:32] out as the best bang for the buck in
[00:35] that crowded segment. I mean, you could
[00:37] get a Lucid Gravity for well into the
[00:39] six digits, or you could get a really,
[00:41] really wellsp speced Hyundai Ionic 9 for
[00:45] under 80 grand. Now, it might sound
[00:46] weird to say bang for the buck when the
[00:48] car is still 70, 80 grand, and that's
[00:50] still expensive, but this category is
[00:53] expensive. Lucid Gravity, like I said,
[00:55] the R1S regularly is six figures. the
[00:58] EQS, the Cadillacs, these are all
[01:00] expensive vehicles. And now that I flew
[01:02] with this for a week, it definitely has
[01:05] all of the same features as those. It's
[01:08] really well equipped, but for less
[01:10] money. So, let's just start with those
[01:12] basics. This is 110 kWh battery in
[01:16] between a dual motor system, all-wheel
[01:18] drive, and it does about 420 horsepower
[01:22] and 500 lb feet of torque. I'll talk
[01:24] more about how it it actually drives a
[01:26] little bit later in this video, but then
[01:28] it does about 320 to 340 miles of range
[01:32] on a single charge. And okay, this is
[01:34] I've been waiting a while to be able to
[01:35] do this. This is one of the first EVs
[01:38] I've seen slash tested with.
[01:42] Got to go all the way to the back here
[01:44] for it. The NACS port. This is a
[01:47] nonTesla with the Tesla charge port in
[01:49] the US. So, we're going to start seeing
[01:50] these more in 2025 and 2026. This
[01:53] doesn't mean you can charge at every
[01:55] single Tesla supercharger, but without
[01:57] an adapter. Some Tesla Superchargers
[02:00] will let you just plug right in. It's
[02:02] best to just check the map just to make
[02:04] sure cuz you don't want to pull up to
[02:05] the charger and then realize this is not
[02:06] one of the ones that works. It's easy to
[02:08] do that. Uh but yeah, Tesla
[02:11] Superchargers with no adapter. Better
[02:13] some of them than none of them. If you
[02:15] want to get the closest on paper, that
[02:16] would be the Kia EV9, which this shares
[02:20] a platform with. Uh, but this is
[02:22] obviously an Ionic, so it's got this
[02:24] very unique pixel aesthetic at the front
[02:27] with these headlights and all these
[02:29] squares. I really like the Ionic 5 and I
[02:31] think that looks even better than this.
[02:34] But, you know, as far as big three row
[02:35] SUVs go, this is a pretty unique look.
[02:38] There's your headlights down there, your
[02:40] daytime running light pattern up there.
[02:42] Pretty big logo. A whole bunch of black
[02:44] plastic, but still even like the squares
[02:46] are are subtle, but they're consistent
[02:49] with this motif. You get around to the
[02:51] side, it's got these big thick sidewall
[02:53] handcooked tires. I think they are what?
[02:55] It's going to start with a four. Yeah,
[02:56] 285 45 21in wheels. Uh, and so those big
[03:01] thick tires improve your ride quality.
[03:03] Again, we'll get there. You got door
[03:05] handles that recess. This is kind of
[03:07] also like a satin paint color, too. It's
[03:09] silver, but it's not super reflective.
[03:11] And then this back is also very
[03:13] distinct. Look at all these boxes. You
[03:15] know what that reminds me of? you know
[03:16] that Rivian delivery van which has the
[03:19] lights that go all the way around the
[03:20] top of it. This DRL setup, it kind of
[03:22] gives me some of the same vibes, but
[03:24] obviously it's an Ionic 9 instead. You
[03:26] know, if you made me choose like what's
[03:27] the best looking three row SUV, I I
[03:30] don't know if I would pick this one. I
[03:31] think it's it's nice and square and trim
[03:33] and handsome. I think I'd probably pick
[03:35] the Kia EV9 aesthetics slightly over it.
[03:39] Maybe that's just me. Uh, but I think we
[03:42] should get to the inside because I think
[03:43] that's exactly where you start seeing
[03:45] the value for the money. So, Ionic 9 on
[03:48] that door handle and again down here and
[03:51] again down here.
[03:53] But as soon as you get to the driver's
[03:54] seat, okay, I already have the AC turned
[03:56] on cuz it's about 1,000°. In fact, what
[03:59] does it say? It's It's only 89 right
[04:01] now, but it's going up to 98. It's going
[04:03] to be a billion degrees in here. So, I'm
[04:05] going to have the AC on. Sorry. But this
[04:07] is where you start seeing how well
[04:08] equipped this thing is. There's a lot of
[04:10] good features here. I'm going to I'm
[04:11] going to go left to right because that
[04:12] makes it easy. So, to the left of the
[04:13] driver, you got this nice perforation in
[04:15] this soft door over here. You got
[04:17] storage down here. And you've got the
[04:19] Bose speaker system. And the Bose
[04:22] speakers all around this car, I think,
[04:24] sound pretty good. If I was giving them
[04:26] a rating, they'd be like a B. They're
[04:29] not bad. And I specifically paired my
[04:31] phone to this, so I'm doing Bluetooth
[04:32] audio, and there's good stuff coming out
[04:34] of these speakers. You also have this
[04:36] plastic door handle, but you've got
[04:38] memory seats over here. You've got power
[04:40] folding and power adjusting mirrors,
[04:42] which look pretty good. Then you get to
[04:43] the middle. There's your steering wheel.
[04:45] You've got plenty of controls for media
[04:47] on the steering wheel, as well as the
[04:49] screens behind it. You have an HUD,
[04:51] which is nice and crisp. Of course, the
[04:53] camera doesn't Hey, there you go. You
[04:54] can pick that up. Uh, and then you have
[04:56] a second screen over here, which
[04:57] supports CarPlay, Android Auto, both
[04:59] wireless. You can drop your phone down
[05:02] here with wireless charging. It tends to
[05:04] heat up the phone, but you can drop it
[05:06] there if you want to. Two cup holders, a
[05:07] little bit of storage in here. I uh I
[05:10] want to say real quick, I think this key
[05:12] is ugly. I don't know if a lot of people
[05:15] usually comment about the key fob when
[05:17] they review a car, but this even though
[05:19] it's functional and everything, it just
[05:20] this is just ugly. But there's a spot
[05:23] right there to put the key fob when
[05:25] you're driving. So, if you care about
[05:27] that, there's some more storage here and
[05:29] some more storage underneath here. and
[05:31] then a decent mix of touchscreen
[05:33] controls and physical controls. So, this
[05:35] is a touchcreen and it's very responsive
[05:37] and their software has been great for a
[05:39] while, but then like having to hit this
[05:41] tiny button for the fan speed, I I don't
[05:44] love that. I think that's kind of lame.
[05:47] You got the physical movement for uh
[05:49] pointing the vents or opening and
[05:51] closing the vents. And then you've got
[05:52] controls like home here will always take
[05:54] you home. If you want to go to CarPlay,
[05:56] that'll always jump in there. So, these
[05:58] are functional. You start to get to know
[05:59] them. You also have controls on the
[06:01] steering wheel. There's your volume.
[06:03] There's your track forward and backward.
[06:04] It's probably going to start playing
[06:05] now. That's copyrighted. My fault. And
[06:08] then you've got these paddles behind the
[06:10] steering wheel to increase and decrease
[06:12] regen. And there, like I said, is the
[06:14] range. It's saying like 220 mi of range
[06:16] with 64% battery. It's overstating at
[06:19] least telling me it's going to get more
[06:21] range than I was quoted when, you know,
[06:23] you first learn about the car. It says
[06:25] 310 mi of range. Seems like it can get
[06:26] like 330 or 340. Anyway, let's finish
[06:28] off to the right here. This is a start
[06:30] stop button that you do actually have to
[06:32] press to turn the car off. I don't love
[06:33] that EVs all kind of do that still, but
[06:36] that's the button. And then you have
[06:37] this twist to go into drive or push to
[06:40] park. Then over here you have your mode
[06:43] selector for what drive mode you're in.
[06:45] So, sport, normal, or eco. And then you
[06:48] also have auto hold on and off and to
[06:50] turn on and off the parking cameras real
[06:51] quick. Great. And then also this little
[06:54] uh marble accent piece I don't love.
[06:58] It's clearly plastic, but it does kind
[07:00] of shine the LED lights onto it, so you
[07:02] can see it at night, and it kind of has
[07:04] this nice glow, but I don't know, that's
[07:07] not my favorite piece. Uh, this screen
[07:08] kind of curves a little bit as well. And
[07:10] then, boom, look up here. This is a rear
[07:12] view camera. You can switch it on or
[07:14] off, although I tend to leave it on. So,
[07:17] the mirror itself is still a fine mirror
[07:20] if you want that, but this camera is a
[07:23] little bit lower than before. I think it
[07:25] was maybe the Ionic 5 or some previous
[07:27] EVs have had it higher up pointed down
[07:30] at the road. This is more like at bumper
[07:31] level. Either way, it's super useful.
[07:34] And then these seats are very
[07:36] comfortable. I've been sitting in them
[07:38] happily for days. They are ventilated.
[07:40] They are heated. You can move them
[07:42] forward and backward without sitting in
[07:43] them. And we'll get to the other rows in
[07:45] a second, but this is nice. You also
[07:48] have this sunroof that opens and closes
[07:50] and has a motorized cover. And just in
[07:53] general, well equipped is the theme
[07:56] here. Uh you can actually turn on the
[07:57] massaging seats for a long drive if you
[08:00] want to. I almost never do. I don't
[08:02] really care about them, but you have
[08:04] them. Has anyone ever bought a car
[08:06] because of the massaging seats? That's
[08:09] my question to you. Have you ever bought
[08:10] a car and been like, "Oh, I can never
[08:12] buy another car without massaging seats
[08:15] again." Because I've never experienced a
[08:18] good massage from a car seat before.
[08:21] Maybe. Maybe that's just me, but hey,
[08:23] this is a three row SUV and definitely
[08:25] not a minivan. So, second and third row
[08:28] space is a very big deal. So, these are
[08:30] the captain seat setup. So, they've got
[08:33] two large middle seats with a gap
[08:34] between them and then a third row. This
[08:37] second row is nice again cuz you have
[08:41] this opening and closing sunroof. The
[08:43] bar in the middle doesn't bother me too
[08:45] much. I like that it can open and close.
[08:47] And then plenty of foot room. There's
[08:49] room for my feet under the seat in front
[08:50] of me. And of course, you've got this
[08:52] this nice net here. A lot of people
[08:54] actually love this net. Uh maybe if you
[08:57] have babies in the back seat, this is a
[08:58] nice shade for them. But that net is
[09:00] there. The aesthetic is matched. Two
[09:02] more cup holders. Two more cup holders.
[09:05] Hold on a second.
[09:07] Cubby storage space and more HI controls
[09:10] back here. This is a nice back seat, but
[09:13] there's three rows. So, let me just go
[09:15] ahead and shimmy back here real quick.
[09:18] This is not the easiest, but it is
[09:21] possible. There you go. So, third row I
[09:25] wouldn't want to sit in. I'm 6'3. I put
[09:27] a 63 driving position. And then I have
[09:29] another seat in front of me here. So,
[09:32] not the most leg room, as is pretty
[09:37] typical for this class, but it is
[09:39] possible. Also, if I'm the only one in
[09:41] the back, I tend to stretch my legs out.
[09:43] Two more cup holders. Another cup
[09:45] holder. forward and backward motorized
[09:48] seat movement. I'll get to that in a
[09:50] second when I go to the trunk. But also,
[09:51] there's a lot of USBC
[09:54] uh charging everywhere, especially if
[09:56] you're in the second row. That's going
[09:57] to be useful, too. So, not bad. Bose
[10:00] speakers get back here. Vents get back
[10:02] here. I'm fine in the back seat for a
[10:04] short ride. This is a normal throw SUV.
[10:07] When I say well equipped, though, that
[10:08] actually really means a lot when it
[10:10] comes to the back because, you know,
[10:11] people store things in these massive
[10:13] SUVs. So, this button over here at the
[10:15] corner gives me my power opening
[10:17] tailgate,
[10:19] which shows me a pretty reasonable
[10:21] amount of storage space before I even
[10:22] fold anything down. Like, that is plenty
[10:24] of space for groceries or whatever.
[10:26] There's a tiny bit of sub trunk, so
[10:27] cables, maybe some grocery bags. Um, but
[10:30] then over on the side, you have the 110
[10:32] volt outlet. That is nice. And then
[10:35] these buttons here are pretty key
[10:37] because this is power folding second and
[10:40] third row. So, if I hit this third row
[10:42] right side button, it's going to
[10:44] powerfold this seat down, flips the
[10:47] headrest down, and gives me a flat floor
[10:50] to put whatever I want in. That suddenly
[10:51] becomes much more storage. I can fold
[10:53] both of these down. But second row does
[10:55] the same thing. So, I hit the second row
[10:57] right side. This is going to move the
[10:59] seat up, fold this down, and give me
[11:01] even more flat floor. So, now I can fit,
[11:04] if I fold all these seats down, I can
[11:06] fit a m I can fit a bicycle back here.
[11:08] here. I can fit massive boxes, whatever
[11:10] amount of storage you please, cuz that
[11:13] is super useful. And then a lot of
[11:15] these, you've probably seen other cars
[11:16] where like you can hit the button, it'll
[11:18] fold them down, but if you want to pull
[11:19] them back up, you got to like really
[11:21] reach inside. But not with this. This is
[11:24] powerfolding back up. Both of these rows
[11:27] will powerfold themselves back into
[11:29] place to return to being useful seats. I
[11:31] do have to manually do that, but that's
[11:33] it. That's awesome. Super well equipped.
[11:36] So, as you can imagine, living with this
[11:38] thing with this amount of storage and
[11:41] all these features and the NACS port and
[11:43] the great range is is great. But then
[11:46] there's also driving it. So, what's that
[11:49] like? Well, it's about what you'd
[11:52] expect. It's nice. This is a very, very
[11:54] quiet, soft, plush SUV. I say quiet,
[11:58] first of all, because the cabin
[12:00] isolation, and I think there's also A&C
[12:02] at play here. Uh either way, sitting
[12:04] inside here is very quiet and
[12:06] comfortable. And then the combination of
[12:08] the soft suspension built in, the thick
[12:10] sidewall on these tires. And just the
[12:12] overall tuning for a smooth ride has
[12:16] been really, really comfortable. It's
[12:18] also, I mean, it's it's the little
[12:19] things like it's a big, pretty soft,
[12:21] plush steering wheel. It's the general
[12:24] lack of distractions when you have this
[12:26] much visibility and, you know, a pretty
[12:28] reasonable, you know, small display in
[12:30] front of you on the HUD and just riding
[12:32] and cruising along. Yeah, it has a
[12:34] sports mode. Who cares? Uh, it is quick,
[12:36] actually, just to be frank. Like, it's
[12:38] all-wheel drive, it's dual motor, and
[12:40] it's 5 400 something horsepower. Um, but
[12:43] in general, if you're if you're doing
[12:44] road trips, I love that it's the NACS
[12:46] Sport. I love that it's well over 300
[12:48] miles of range, and it's like an honest
[12:50] 300 miles of range, too. and it seems to
[12:53] have no issues with, you know, just
[12:55] basic like being able to change the
[12:57] amount of regen on the fly. And, you
[12:59] know, if you're cruising on the highway,
[13:00] maybe you just want to put it in coast
[13:01] and do that for a while. But if you're
[13:03] in day-to-day bumper-to-bumper traffic,
[13:05] having the regen is efficient. All this
[13:08] stuff is nice. Uh, so I have no
[13:09] complaints about driving this thing. You
[13:12] feel the weight when you're turning.
[13:14] Sure. I think it's like 6,000 lb. But
[13:17] again, almost nothing in this class is
[13:19] tuned to be super sporty other than
[13:21] maybe like the quad motor R1S or some of
[13:23] those. Uh, so I think this does a good
[13:25] job of being nice, soft, and comfortable
[13:28] all the time. I think my only real
[13:29] downsides with this, honestly, are
[13:30] pretty minor. I'll give you my top
[13:32] three. One is this looks and feels
[13:36] pretty cheap. Two is this looks and
[13:41] feels even cheaper. It's functional, but
[13:44] god, I just I hate looking at it. And
[13:46] three, uh I think the front trunk, which
[13:49] honestly they probably don't expect
[13:51] people to use very often, uh is pretty
[13:53] tiny and honestly I'll probably never
[13:55] use it, but I'll show it to you anyway
[13:57] just so you can tell. This is the Ionic
[14:00] 9's front trunk. It's already full of
[14:03] cables. These are adapters for the NACS
[14:06] port and a charging cable. So, small
[14:09] front trunk, not particularly useful.
[14:11] That's a tiny third downside. But
[14:14] overall, I mean, I'm impressed. Satin
[14:17] paint, pixel lights, they're growing on
[14:20] me. The aesthetic is growing on me. I'll
[14:22] admit it. I think it's pretty handsome.
[14:24] But let me know what you think. Is this
[14:26] the best equipped sub $80,000
[14:30] fully electric three row SUV? It's a
[14:32] pretty specific category, but there's a
[14:34] lot in it. I think this might be the
[14:36] one. Let me know if you'd pick this or
[14:38] the Kia EV9 in the comments. Thanks for
[14:40] watching. Catch you in the next one.
