[00:00] Welcome back to the Ionic Guy featuring
[00:02] Fuel Sport. It's been one year with this
[00:05] 2024 EV9. We've put 13,000 miles on it,
[00:10] and it's been great for a family of
[00:12] four. There's been ups, there's been
[00:15] downs. I'm not sure if it's my favorite
[00:17] three row electric SUV right now, but
[00:20] we've had it for a year. We're going to
[00:21] have it for a couple more at least, and
[00:23] we're going to go over some of the good
[00:25] and the bad that I've experienced in the
[00:26] last 13,000 miles. Let's get into it.
[00:30] So, while I'm on my way to the car wash,
[00:32] I wanted to capture some driving
[00:33] impressions after one year. The one
[00:37] thing that has not changed in this car
[00:39] is the feeling that you were driving a
[00:42] couch. I've driven other big vehicles
[00:45] like this, uh, like a Tahoe, uh, Rivian
[00:48] R1S, and they all drive a little bit
[00:51] more composed. the EV9, no matter what
[00:54] you do, even if you align it, it just
[00:56] seems like there's a little bit of play
[00:58] in the rear end, like you're driving on
[01:00] ice when you go over bumps. And this is
[01:02] a problem that's plagued a lot of people
[01:04] since this car was released. Even if you
[01:07] get the alignment dialed in on the rear
[01:09] with, I believe it's negative one degree
[01:11] of camber to exactly what Kia wants, the
[01:15] car just skates around when you hit a
[01:17] certain type of bump and feels like the
[01:20] back end is going to go out on you.
[01:23] So, a few months after we bought the
[01:25] car, I brought it to a friend to try to
[01:28] get some sort of custom alignment done.
[01:29] I really wanted the rear wheels to have
[01:31] as much positive camber or as little
[01:35] negative camber as you can possibly do
[01:38] while still being within Kia specs. So,
[01:41] we had it aligned to negative.6° 6°
[01:43] camber and it really didn't do anything
[01:46] other than improve the tire wear, which
[01:48] was a huge plus because they were
[01:50] getting torn up with the factory
[01:51] alignment. The camber was at 1.6°
[01:55] and the toe was all messed up. So, tire
[01:59] wear kind of suffered early on, but more
[02:01] on that later.
[02:03] Other than that, we've been pleased with
[02:04] the amount of power in the light long
[02:06] range trim. Uh 201 horsepower sounds
[02:09] like it's not much for a car this size,
[02:11] but it's completely adequate just
[02:12] because it's electric. The torque is
[02:15] totally fine for city driving. You you
[02:18] do notice a lack of power on the highway
[02:20] for passing. If you have, you know, a
[02:22] full load of of kids and stuff in the
[02:24] back and you just want to pass somebody
[02:27] going 80, you're going to floor it and
[02:30] not much is going to happen. But it's
[02:32] still faster than cars that are 20 years
[02:34] older than this. and it's totally safe
[02:36] for normal driving. We're we're we're
[02:38] happy with it. I wasn't willing to pay
[02:40] 20,000 more for a GT line. And for you
[02:42] Northerners out there, I will say that
[02:45] winter driving in the rearwheel drive
[02:47] EV9 has been outstanding.
[02:50] We put Michelin XI snow tires on, and
[02:54] this car was totally stable in the snow
[02:57] and ice last year. I would go out in
[03:00] winter storms on purpose just to try to
[03:02] get this car to break loose. and it
[03:05] really gripped well. Uh, when you take
[03:07] into account the weight distribution of
[03:08] this car, uh, the fact that it's
[03:10] basically 6,000 lb and the fact that
[03:13] it's an EV with excellent traction
[03:15] control, it makes for a great winter
[03:17] car. You don't need all-wheel drive. I
[03:20] live on a steep hill and even in a
[03:22] couple inches of snow, I stopped dead,
[03:24] floored it, and the car just figured it
[03:26] out and it went. And I was really
[03:29] impressed because I have an all-wheel
[03:30] drive Tesla with snow tires and
[03:33] obviously that's insane in the snow and
[03:36] this was not far behind. It was very
[03:38] impressive. So I would say anyone
[03:41] looking to get a rear wheel drive EV9,
[03:42] but you're worried about winter
[03:44] performance, don't be. Just get a good
[03:46] set of tires.
[03:49] Here we go.
[04:09] I had no plans for a 0 to 60 run on this
[04:12] video, but here we are. 33% state of
[04:16] charge.
[04:28] 60.
[04:35] It's enough.
[04:36] It's not great. It's not fast. It's
[04:40] good.
[04:42] One thing that hasn't changed after one
[04:43] year is the HDA2 implementation on this
[04:46] car. I still don't really like it. Uh,
[04:49] having a car with autopilot kind of
[04:51] ruined me for other driver assistance
[04:54] packages because even in minor bends,
[04:57] the HDA2 assist will just let go without
[05:01] warning. And I know out of spec also
[05:04] encountered this in their hogback
[05:05] challenge with the EV9. It's just
[05:08] completely random as to which corners it
[05:11] will stick in the lane with and which
[05:13] corners it will just completely let go
[05:15] and drive you right into a guardrail if
[05:18] you're not paying attention. So, I find
[05:19] it kind of dangerous. But the things I
[05:22] do like about it after a year are the
[05:25] auto lane change feature. If I signal,
[05:28] it will stage a a lane change all on its
[05:31] own. And
[05:36] yeah, it actually just canceled its own
[05:38] lane change because there's a car in
[05:40] front of me even though it's nowhere
[05:41] near us. So yeah, it probably needs more
[05:45] cameras and it probably just needs more
[05:47] intelligence and HDA isn't something
[05:49] that Kia or Hyundai really update over
[05:52] the air. Even though they they have the
[05:54] ability to do it, I'm sure improvements
[05:56] can be made every month just like they
[05:57] are on Teslas, but
[06:00] there's nothing to be found as far as
[06:02] any driver assistance upgrades. And that
[06:04] kind of irks me on a car like this where
[06:07] you, you know, it can be a lot better
[06:09] than it is.
[06:13] Charging at home has been effortless. We
[06:15] charge on a Tesla J1772 wall connector
[06:19] set to 48 amps and we've done so ever
[06:21] since we took delivery of the car in May
[06:23] 2024.
[06:25] There's been no issues with the ICCU.
[06:27] Knock on wood. Uh sure. And we took
[06:32] delivery of the car shortly after the
[06:34] ICCU update was actually released by
[06:37] Kia. So a lot of early 2024 cars had
[06:40] ICCU issues because they were running on
[06:42] original software. and we've been good.
[06:46] But we could talk a little bit more
[06:47] about that later. Uh DC charging
[06:49] performance has been excellent. I've
[06:52] reached up to 225 kW at a 350 Electrify
[06:56] America station when they're available
[06:59] and not getting blocked by a Chevy Bolt
[07:01] or an Ron. Yeah, overall we're happy
[07:04] with our purchase as far as charging is
[07:06] concerned. It charges faster than our
[07:08] Tesla that we used to take on road
[07:09] trips. And it has proven itself to be an
[07:12] excellent road trip car with how fast it
[07:14] can charge.
[07:30] While I do a quick Electrify America
[07:32] session to top up the car before I bring
[07:34] it back later, I thought that I might go
[07:36] over a couple accessories we've gotten
[07:37] for the car in the last year. The
[07:39] coolest ones I think we've gotten is the
[07:41] Fit Cam dash cam that mounts right up
[07:44] here in what appears to be a Kia plastic
[07:48] cover, but it's actually an aftermarket
[07:51] dash cam. And there's the SD card. So, I
[07:56] was spoiled with my other car and I
[07:58] wanted to get a dash cam for this that
[08:00] always records just in case. For anyone
[08:02] curious, we're cooking along at about
[08:04] 212 kW at 87 Fahrenheit. It's been a hot
[08:08] one today and this thing is charging
[08:09] super fast. I didn't even precondition
[08:11] it. It was in the sweet spot. Another
[08:13] accessory was a full set of all-weather
[08:16] rubber mats from Amazon. I got these on
[08:19] Amazon Vine for free. Uh, not everyone
[08:22] will have that privilege, but uh,
[08:23] there's plenty of generic
[08:26] mats on Amazon that will make your car a
[08:30] little bit more kid-proof. We've got one
[08:32] back here in the third row as well.
[08:36] As you can see, it's all well used.
[08:40] And this one isn't really EV9 specific,
[08:42] but we have a little wired baby monitor,
[08:44] so we don't have to have a mirror
[08:46] anymore. Uh, this thing is awesome for
[08:48] not having to crane your neck behind you
[08:49] to see if the baby's asleep. Uh, it just
[08:52] mounts on a nice suction cup there. And
[08:55] I've wired it down the side,
[08:59] tucked it underneath here, and it pops
[09:02] out there and goes into the 12vt outlet
[09:05] with a little button.
[09:08] Just a neat little thing that'll work on
[09:10] any car.
[09:15] Moving up front, you might be able to
[09:17] see that the tires aren't in the
[09:19] greatest of condition. This is due to
[09:21] the alignment that was wildly out of
[09:24] spec in the rear when we took delivery
[09:26] of the car. And we ran it for about
[09:28] 6,000 mi before that got corrected. So,
[09:32] that took the tires down from 932 to 532
[09:36] in the rear in pretty short order. This
[09:38] car only has 10,000 mi on the original
[09:41] tires because I ran our winter tires for
[09:43] 3,000 mi. So, let's see where we're at
[09:47] right now.
[09:49] Yeah, the fronts are at 432s right now.
[09:52] These aren't going to see next year. I'm
[09:53] going to have to replace them in the
[09:55] spring when I put a new set of all
[09:58] seasons back on and take the winter
[10:00] tires off. I'm going to run to the back
[10:01] right now and get a measurement real
[10:04] quick.
[10:08] Yep, we're at 432 in the rear as well.
[10:11] And they don't look too hot back there
[10:13] on the sides. So, even after I got an
[10:16] alignment to correct the camber and the
[10:18] toe issue in the rear, this thing is
[10:20] still big and heavy and the tires are
[10:22] taking a beating. So, I don't know what
[10:24] I'm going to do next year. I might look
[10:26] for an alternative that has a higher
[10:28] starting tread depth, but these are kind
[10:31] of affordable right now, especially
[10:33] wholesale. So, I think they're only mid
[10:36] hundreds, like 160, 170 a piece, which
[10:39] isn't terrible. We drive it like an EV.
[10:41] We we go quickly off the line. So, I
[10:43] know that, you know, if if they were all
[10:45] highway miles and a more gentler driver
[10:48] was in the driver's seat, we'd get a lot
[10:50] more mileage out of them, but we enjoy
[10:53] our EVs here at Field Sport, and I'm
[10:55] willing to pay that small price in tires
[10:58] to drive them how we want to drive them.
[11:00] The seat and cabin comfort has been a
[11:03] sticking point for me. I'm 6'4
[11:06] and I find that when I'm actually at a
[11:08] comfortable position for my legs, the
[11:11] wheel is I mean that you have to drive
[11:13] with your arms straight out and it's
[11:15] it's just too far away even with it
[11:17] fully extended. Same with the dashboard.
[11:19] I know other reviewers have mentioned
[11:21] this too. Everything just seems really
[11:23] far away. Um it's not a not a driver's
[11:26] car, but if you're just cruising on the
[11:28] highway like this, you know, arm on the
[11:30] armrest, it's not terrible. But for city
[11:33] driving or long distance drives, I find
[11:35] it a bit unergonomic, I guess you could
[11:40] say. Um, I did space out the front of
[11:44] the seat with nylon spacers to get a
[11:46] little bit more thigh support for these
[11:48] ridiculously long legs. That's something
[11:51] Brandon Flash also did over on his
[11:52] YouTube channel for his F-150 Lightning.
[11:55] I believe he's uh a little bit over six
[11:57] foot, too. And finds that, you know, the
[12:00] lack of leg support here.
[12:03] It can be improved by actually tilting
[12:05] the seat back a little bit. So, I do
[12:07] that in most of my cars and it it works
[12:10] pretty well. I forgot to mention the
[12:13] range. It's pretty good. For example, my
[12:17] wife went to almost the tip of Long
[12:20] Island. We live in upstate New York. She
[12:22] went to essentially Monttok, Long Island
[12:25] and
[12:27] the trip was about I think 310 320 mi
[12:31] and she did it in one shot which was
[12:34] incredible. I will say that the climate
[12:36] was off. It was a perfect day. It was
[12:38] like 70°, sunny, no need for AC, and she
[12:43] kept the speed at about 70 mph,
[12:46] and made it in one trip with, I think,
[12:49] 15% remaining. So, the efficiency on
[12:52] this car has been proven. Uh, she proved
[12:55] it again. It's a monster for range, and
[12:59] I can only imagine what the rear wheel
[13:00] drive Ionic 9 can do now with an even
[13:02] bigger battery. If you're a road tripper
[13:04] and you don't like charging, this is
[13:07] definitely the one to get. Even with the
[13:09] climate on, in a worst case scenario,
[13:11] hot weather type of vacation, um, we
[13:14] went to the Jersey Shore and it was 104°
[13:16] on the highway. AC was blasting front
[13:19] and rear and it still was in the high
[13:22] 200s. You can't beat the efficiency of
[13:24] this car. Uh, the light long range rear
[13:26] wheel drive with the base tires is just
[13:30] a range king. and and we're really happy
[13:33] with that. Even though charging isn't
[13:35] that much of a burden on this car, I
[13:37] purposefully left some junk in the back
[13:39] to show you what a great family car this
[13:41] is. We've got a stroller, grocery bags,
[13:44] backpack, all sorts of stuff. And with
[13:46] the third row down, plenty of storage.
[13:48] It's like a little pickup truck back
[13:50] here. One qual we found is that the load
[13:54] floor is extremely high and there is no
[13:56] usable sub trunk, which is a big shame
[13:59] because we've grown used to that. It's
[14:01] almost a tossup as to how much stuff we
[14:03] can cleverly fit in here compared to the
[14:05] Tesla Model Y just because the Y has
[14:08] such a bigger frunk and it has a huge
[14:11] well under here for all sorts of stuff.
[14:15] I mean, you could basically throw a
[14:16] stroller in the sub trunk of the Model
[14:18] Y, whereas up here it has to take up
[14:20] space. So, packaging wise, it seems like
[14:23] the legacy manufacturers still haven't
[14:25] figured out how to hide storage in
[14:28] clever places, but we're still happy
[14:32] with how big this car is, and that's the
[14:34] reason we got it. We've used the third
[14:36] row occasionally. I fit back there just
[14:39] fine, which is incredible. Uh there's no
[14:42] complaints in the third row from anyone
[14:43] that's ever been back there. And for
[14:46] kids, it's it's a breeze. So certainly
[14:49] happy with the six-seater captain's
[14:52] chair layout. That's definitely the way
[14:54] to go for road trips if you know that
[14:56] you're never going to have a seventh
[14:57] person in this car. You may be asking
[14:59] the question, will it baby? So even with
[15:02] a rear-facing infant seat, I still do
[15:04] fit in the front row.
[15:10] It's not ideal. I don't have the leg
[15:13] support that I have in the driver's seat
[15:15] and I can't go back any further, but
[15:17] it's fine. It It works. Uh it I can't
[15:20] wait till the kid is turned around in
[15:22] front facing, but that'll be a few more
[15:25] years.
[15:27] I'm going to power it up. It's hot out.
[15:30] Let's get some AC cranking. Oh, that's
[15:33] right. Phone is key doesn't work. Even
[15:34] though the phone is right there filming
[15:36] us right now. Yeah, that's
[15:39] [Music]
[15:42] Let's see if the fingerprint works. Oh
[15:45] my god, it did.
[15:48] Okay, so that was my uh get out of jail
[15:52] card, right? So, I suppose now would be
[15:54] a good time to talk about that. I
[15:57] haven't been impressed with the phone as
[15:58] key implementation in here. It uses
[16:00] Apple Car Key, and it seems that the
[16:03] manufacturers that use a proprietary
[16:06] app-based phone key have a system that
[16:08] works every time a lot more reliably.
[16:11] This car requires me to put my phone in
[16:15] the charging pad, which is, I believe,
[16:17] where the antenna is for the phone key.
[16:21] And if it's anywhere else, pushing this
[16:23] button does nothing. Um, if it's in my
[16:25] pocket like it would be in a Tesla or a
[16:28] Rivian, it doesn't work. And it's super
[16:31] frustrating getting in the car without a
[16:33] key fob because I'm sitting here.
[16:35] Sometimes, even when I do put the phone
[16:36] in here, it takes 10 to 15 presses of
[16:39] this button and moving the phone around
[16:41] like an inch at a time to find the sweet
[16:43] spot. And I can never get the car booted
[16:46] up. Not an issue for my wife. She keeps
[16:48] the key fob in her purse. I don't have a
[16:50] purse. I I just carry my phone
[16:52] everywhere I go. I don't really even
[16:54] bring my wallet most places. So, if
[16:57] you're that kind of person, this might
[16:58] be an issue. Hopefully, it gets better,
[17:00] but I don't know if that's on the Apple
[17:02] side or on the Kia side. I'm inclined to
[17:05] believe it's a Kia problem just because
[17:07] of where they have their sensors or the
[17:09] antenna for the phone key, but that's
[17:12] something I'm not quite sure on yet.
[17:14] While we're in here, overtheair updates
[17:17] have been a little more frequent than I
[17:19] expected from Kia. They're not on the
[17:22] level of Tesla where they come every
[17:23] couple weeks or every month, but there
[17:25] have been substantial improvements to
[17:27] items that have come out as a technical
[17:29] service bulletin, like the rear inverter
[17:31] update for Tesla Supercharging. Hyundai
[17:34] still hasn't fixed that bug yet, but the
[17:36] EV9 got it a couple months ago, and
[17:38] these things charge at superchargers
[17:40] flawlessly now with no interruptions in
[17:42] charging halfway through for no reason.
[17:45] Uh, a couple other updates that have
[17:47] come through recently are, I believe,
[17:49] the shift control unit that just dropped
[17:51] a couple weeks ago. Um, but that update
[17:54] came out back in January at the dealer.
[17:56] So, most cars already have that. Uh,
[17:58] there was the ICCU update, the water
[18:00] pump logic update, and they've ironed
[18:04] out a lot of bugs without requiring a
[18:06] trip to the dealership, which I've found
[18:08] very nice. uh EV ownership should have
[18:13] OTAA updates and Kia is delivering on
[18:16] that and I'm I'm pleasantly surprised.
[18:20] I know I said I would talk about the
[18:21] ICCU issues and I wish I had something
[18:24] better to say, but it looks like it's
[18:26] still not fixed.
[18:28] Recently on Reddit, there have been
[18:30] reports of at least one 2025 EV9 that's
[18:34] having an ICCU replaced at the dealer.
[18:37] And that's unfortunate because the 2025s
[18:40] come out of the factory with fully
[18:41] updated vehicles. They've got the latest
[18:43] software for the for the water pump and
[18:45] the latest software for the ICCU.
[18:48] So, if this is the case, it kind of
[18:50] scares me and I I didn't want to go down
[18:53] this road, but I'm kind of on Corbin's
[18:55] side with recommending these cars right
[18:58] now. Uh I know he's saying, you know,
[19:01] don't buy an Ionic 5 or Ionic 6 or an
[19:03] EV6 because it's too risky. Uh they
[19:07] Hyundai and Kia clearly haven't fixed
[19:09] this problem yet. And if you're going to
[19:11] get one of these cars, it's best to just
[19:13] lease it for two or three years. I
[19:15] thought we were in the clear on the EV9.
[19:17] Our car is a November 2023 build, and we
[19:21] picked it up in May 2024, which means it
[19:25] had all of the updates before delivery,
[19:27] and it had only been charged once. So
[19:29] that's why I think it's been fine this
[19:31] whole time. We've driven it entirely on
[19:33] updated software and there's been no
[19:36] issues even with 48 amp charging. But
[19:40] the early early EV9s, you know, just
[19:43] like ours, when they were purchased
[19:44] immediately after build, they were run
[19:47] with old software until April or May
[19:49] 2024,
[19:51] leaving them vulnerable to this failure.
[19:53] And that was primarily due to the ICCU's
[19:55] overheating due to bad logic in the
[19:57] water pump firmware and just general
[20:00] software of the ICCU itself. So, it
[20:05] should be fixed. I guess it isn't. And
[20:08] that really sucks because now we've got
[20:10] people worrying about whether they're
[20:13] 50, 60, 70, sometimes $80,000 EV9 is
[20:16] going to be in the shop for a month or
[20:19] longer just waiting for parts. My advice
[20:21] to anyone in this situation with a Kia
[20:25] EV6, EV9, or any of the Ionic EVs out
[20:28] there is to ask your claims
[20:31] representative for a goodwill credit. If
[20:33] you're not looking forward to lemoning
[20:35] your car if you want to keep your car,
[20:37] there have been cases where Hyundai and
[20:38] Kia will throw you a couple thousand or
[20:41] more to keep your car and wave your
[20:44] right to a buyback just in the interest
[20:47] of keeping you as a customer in your
[20:49] vehicle. There was one person on Reddit
[20:51] recently that was not subject to an NDA
[20:54] and they said they got $8,000 from Kia
[20:56] just to keep their EV9 while they waited
[20:59] for a new ICCU. So, it can be very
[21:01] lucrative to keep your car and stick in
[21:03] whatever loaner they give you. Even if
[21:05] it's, you know, like KiaForte or
[21:07] something like that, they will pay you.
[21:09] They don't want these cars back with a
[21:11] branded title. They want you to stay in
[21:13] your car. They want to fix it once an
[21:14] ICCU becomes available. So, just a a top
[21:17] tip if you're wondering about uh what to
[21:21] do in an ICCU failure situation.
[21:25] But this old girl hasn't had any issues
[21:28] so far. We've had no failures under
[21:30] warranty. No warranty work has been
[21:31] done. It's only gone in for a state
[21:34] inspection and a couple software updates
[21:36] that weren't available over the air at
[21:38] the time. So, yeah, we're happy with it.
[21:41] It's a great family hauler and unless
[21:43] something happens, it's going to be
[21:44] around for the 2-year update next year.
[21:46] EV9 owners, please sound off in the
[21:48] comments. Let me know how you like
[21:49] yours, if you've had any ICCU failures
[21:52] on your 24 or 25. Hopefully the 2026 has
[21:56] it ironed out, but only time will tell.
