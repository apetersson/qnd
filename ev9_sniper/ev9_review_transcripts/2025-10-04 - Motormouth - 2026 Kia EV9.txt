[00:00] We've got the Kia EV9. It's all
[00:03] electric.
[00:03] >> And we have an update for you. If you
[00:05] think your panel in your house can't
[00:07] support an EV charger,
[00:09] >> Zach's holding on.
[00:14] There is something about that instant
[00:16] acceleration with an EV.
[00:18] >> Well, there is something, Andre. It's
[00:19] called My Breakfast just went up here.
[00:22] >> I don't like that feeling. There's a few
[00:24] things that irritate me about this car.
[00:26] I'm going to say it right now, Andrea.
[00:27] The stupid door handles irritate me. I
[00:29] feel better now. I got that off my
[00:31] chest.
[00:31] >> Okay, we do have a solution for a
[00:33] charging problem. We're going to tell
[00:35] you about that in a moment. Right now
[00:36] though, what is powering this EV9?
[00:39] >> There are two all-wheel drive options.
[00:41] The more powerful one has 502 horsepower
[00:45] and 545 pound- feet of torque. It has a
[00:48] 99.8 kWh battery with 418 km, 260 mi of
[00:54] range. The second all-wheel drive option
[00:56] has the same battery size, but less
[00:58] power, 379 horsepower and up to 516
[01:03] pound- feet of torque. It does get more
[01:05] range, though, 455 km, 280 mi. Now, in
[01:10] the US, the GT, more powerful option,
[01:14] will not be available at this time, but
[01:16] Canada still gets it. Now, the rearw
[01:18] wheelel drive models are the range and
[01:20] value leaders. With a 76.1 kwatth
[01:24] battery, 370 kilometers, 230 mi of
[01:27] range, you get 218 horsepower, 258
[01:30] pound- feet of torque. The other one
[01:32] with the larger battery, Andrea
[01:34] mentioned, gets 491 km or 305 miles of
[01:38] range. That is 203 horsepower, 258
[01:41] pound- feet of torque. One of the issues
[01:43] people have with EVs, Andrea, there's
[01:45] like a whole spreadsheet. You got to go
[01:48] through the range, the price, all-wheel
[01:50] drive, rear. It's more head, not heart.
[01:53] >> Yes, it is. There's a lot of figures to
[01:56] take in there, but this is what people
[01:59] are looking for when they want to
[02:01] purchase an electric vehicle.
[02:03] >> So, now we move from the head to the
[02:04] heart. All the nice features that come
[02:07] standard with the EV9. The base trim
[02:09] comes with a 12.3 in touchscreen with
[02:12] navigation, a 12.3 in driver display,
[02:15] wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto,
[02:18] wireless charger, a digital key,
[02:22] eight-way power front seats with lumbar
[02:24] support, heated and ventilated front
[02:27] seats, leatherrett upholstery, second
[02:29] row onetouch tilt, fold and slide, seven
[02:32] passenger seating, and a smart power
[02:35] liftgate.
[02:36] >> Oh, she's big. She's a biggie.
[02:38] >> And heavy.
[02:39] >> Yep.
[02:40] >> And that comes with a driving dynamic
[02:43] that you kind of have to get used to.
[02:44] What's your first takeaway on EV9?
[02:47] >> Comfortable, smooth, but if you are
[02:50] dealing with rougher roads, we don't
[02:53] have so many of those in Vancouver.
[02:55] Because of that heavier battery, you do
[02:58] feel some imperfections.
[03:00] >> Okay, this is a real problem for every
[03:02] brand dealing with large vehicles like a
[03:04] three row SUV like this. Then you've got
[03:06] an almost 100 kWh battery. It's a
[03:10] massive battery that's very heavy. You
[03:12] have to mitigate the bumps. Yeah. And uh
[03:14] that's that's the balance. You have
[03:16] feedback, but then on some situations,
[03:18] it can be a little bit too bumpy.
[03:19] >> Now, this does have an available
[03:21] self-leveling rear suspension and an
[03:24] available heat pump system. If you go
[03:26] with that GT model, it has an electronic
[03:30] limited slip differential, upgraded
[03:33] brakes, and adaptive suspension, and
[03:36] exclusive GT badge front calipers.
[03:39] Remember, we saw it, Zach, at the LA
[03:41] Auto Show, and it had all those neon
[03:43] green elements to it.
[03:45] >> Nice. I can't unsee it. It wouldn't be
[03:47] my choice, but but yes, I I clearly
[03:50] remember that. That's the performance
[03:52] model Andrew mentioned. It's not going
[03:53] to be available in the United States
[03:54] right away. We're kind of guessing it's
[03:56] probably tariff related, but at least
[03:58] it's coming to Canada where we have a
[03:59] free trade agreement with South Korea.
[04:01] Yes.
[04:02] >> All right. So, Andrea, this is what gets
[04:04] everybody excited about EVs. We're just
[04:06] coming up at highway speeds. Now, before
[04:08] we do that, uh what do you have to put
[04:10] it in?
[04:11] >> Well, you got to put it in. Ask for
[04:12] subscribe. And if you can hit that
[04:13] notification bell, you'll be notified
[04:15] when all of our reviews drop and then
[04:17] you can watch them.
[04:17] >> And we do this, the Cup Carview, twice a
[04:19] week. The first one drops on Wednesday.
[04:21] >> We put another one out on Saturday. And
[04:22] it's the number one thing you can do for
[04:24] us and it's absolutely free. Hit it,
[04:27] Andrea.
[04:27] >> There we go. Whoa. Sport mode. You did
[04:30] say hit it, Zach.
[04:31] >> I did.
[04:32] >> Look at that. My hair is flowing.
[04:37] >> Now, here we we're on a nice even and
[04:39] smooth pavement. Now, go on this lane
[04:41] cuz this lane is the one where it's
[04:43] She's bumpy.
[04:44] >> So, you can hear it more.
[04:47] >> Feel it. But this has got big ass tires
[04:49] on it, too.
[04:50] >> It does.
[04:50] >> So, get get off this. I had enough of
[04:52] that.
[04:52] >> I like the smoothness better.
[04:54] >> Yeah, smoothness is better.
[04:56] >> Uh, but overall, you're going to find
[04:57] this to be super comfortable. And these
[04:59] headrests, by the way,
[05:01] >> yeah.
[05:02] >> Holy smokes. I like to just lean back
[05:05] like this and cruise along on the
[05:07] highway.
[05:08] >> You know what? It does a lot. Well,
[05:10] >> you know what, Andrea? I I'm I said to
[05:13] Andy before we came out here, I don't
[05:15] want to say it, but I have to say it.
[05:17] >> Okay.
[05:17] >> It has a bit of a minivan vibe to it.
[05:20] >> It does. You know, it's big, boxy,
[05:22] you're sitting up, great outward
[05:24] visibility, all the stuff. You get just
[05:26] missing the doors. But it but but the
[05:28] good news is I got a story to tell you.
[05:31] Last weekend I went to IKEA.
[05:33] >> I know
[05:34] >> someone spotted me and didn't come and
[05:36] say hello.
[05:37] >> They sent me a DM on Instagram and said
[05:39] I saw Zach and I said great on a
[05:42] mission.
[05:43] >> I bought a ton of stuff. I'm redoing the
[05:45] office because my office is an an atomic
[05:49] bomb went off in there. So, time to
[05:50] clean it all up. And you can see I
[05:52] loaded all That's why I'm kind of
[05:54] thinking minivan vibes because it
[05:56] gobbled up a wardrobe, wall units,
[05:59] storage containers, a desk. It gobbled
[06:02] it all up with room to spare.
[06:04] >> And this is quite wide, which I think is
[06:07] why you have that minivan feel.
[06:09] Interestingly enough, the BMW iix has a
[06:14] similar feel to it with that, you know,
[06:16] wider dash. So, it it does remind me a
[06:19] little bit of the way that they handle.
[06:22] It's very similar. Now, this has a drag
[06:25] coefficient of 0.28.
[06:27] And the steering feels very good. It's
[06:30] not too light at all in the EV9, and you
[06:34] can control the regen braking with the
[06:36] paddle shifters if you choose. I got to
[06:38] say that uh I think they've done a good
[06:40] job on the styling because it kind of
[06:42] looks like the Kia family of SUVs like
[06:44] Telluride, but different with a twist on
[06:46] it. Um it's not going to be to
[06:48] everybody's taste. It's a big boxy
[06:50] vehicle with exaggerated um wheel
[06:52] arches, that sort of thing. I I I don't
[06:55] mind the look of it. Um some people
[06:56] might not, but I think it looks pretty
[06:58] cool. Yeah, it's really boxy and I think
[07:01] that that was a good way to go because
[07:03] then you're getting that interior space
[07:06] that you want for families. This is a
[07:08] six or seven passenger vehicle. The
[07:11] third row only two seats. So, if you go
[07:14] with captain's chairs, then you've got
[07:16] that six passenger.
[07:17] >> Oh, it's not available on every trim.
[07:19] It's on the higherend trims. You can get
[07:20] the front grill that is illuminated.
[07:22] This one's set up to kind of match the
[07:24] way the headlamps look, but you can also
[07:27] download and pay sort of a subscription
[07:29] to change and customize the look. That's
[07:31] kind of a unique thing.
[07:32] >> Actually, one of our viewers who owns an
[07:34] EV9, he said that he does that all the
[07:38] time. Just gives it a unique and
[07:40] different look. This EV9 gets 7.8 8 in
[07:43] of ground clearance and comes standard
[07:45] with LED headlamps, LED tail lamps,
[07:48] flush door handle, Zach's favorite,
[07:51] power folding exterior mirrors, 19in
[07:55] wheels available 20 and 21 in, and you
[07:58] get a tire repair kit, which is typical
[08:01] of an electric vehicle.
[08:03] >> Okay, so why don't I like them on this
[08:04] car? This morning is a perfect example.
[08:07] had all the camera bag and the tripod
[08:09] and I go up to the back door and it
[08:11] recognizes I have the key. The door
[08:14] opens. It's like magic. It's a magic
[08:15] show. I put everything in. I close the
[08:17] door. I didn't lock it. I just closed it
[08:19] and then I walk around to the side door
[08:21] and it doesn't recognize me. The doors
[08:24] are shut. So now I got to pull the key
[08:26] out. You paid for the remote key, right?
[08:29] I pull the key out to unlock the doors.
[08:31] And I'm like, why can't it just work? If
[08:33] it just had a regular door handle, as
[08:35] soon as I touch it, it would unlock the
[08:37] door.
[08:37] >> What I do like is the way that they pull
[08:40] out. They dounk heavy and needy, but um
[08:44] I don't really like those flimsy ones
[08:47] that are offered on some electric
[08:49] vehicles, so I like the substance of
[08:52] them. The GT line adds GT line design
[08:55] elements, the digital lighting grill,
[08:57] roof rails, black trim, including the
[08:59] bumpers, and then 21in wheels. Now, the
[09:02] GT model has distinct exterior design
[09:06] elements like 21-in high-performance,
[09:08] Continental tires, GT neon green
[09:11] calipers, and a unique GT lighting
[09:14] pattern with exclusive patterns on the
[09:17] active air flaps.
[09:18] >> For some people, getting an EV is a
[09:21] challenge because maybe they have an
[09:22] older house with an older panel, and
[09:25] you're thinking, "It's going to cost me
[09:26] a fortune to upgrade the panel to
[09:29] support a level two charger." Well, we
[09:32] thought we were in that same situation
[09:33] at our house and someone watched their
[09:35] video. And who watched? And
[09:36] >> yes, Variable Grid and they reached out
[09:38] to us and said, "We can help you. We
[09:41] have a solution for you." We spoke with
[09:44] Variable Grid CEO Dan Laferdy and he
[09:47] explained the whole system to us.
[09:48] >> So, you can imagine we we monitor
[09:50] instantaneously how much power you're
[09:52] using at your house and any available
[09:54] power that you're not using at that time
[09:56] is dedicated to your EV chargers. So we
[09:58] can turn basically give as much power to
[10:00] these two EV chargers based on how much
[10:02] power you're using at your house. People
[10:04] love it because it can avoid very
[10:06] expensive electrical upgrades. I can
[10:08] actually, you know, we when we installed
[10:09] these, we had someone take a quick look
[10:11] and give us a what it would cost to be,
[10:13] you know, upwards of $15,000 to do all
[10:16] of the electrical work, the permitting
[10:18] for BC Hydro, um, which is your local
[10:21] utility here, and all the landscaping
[10:23] you need because you have what's called
[10:24] an underground service. So they have to
[10:25] trench up and and bury the line. So that
[10:27] was the problem for us. We didn't want
[10:29] to spend a whole pile of money to get a
[10:31] level two charger. Now you can have it
[10:34] installed on your panel for roughly the
[10:36] same price as everyone else.
[10:37] >> For sure. And Kia and Variable Grid have
[10:40] partnered. They are going to be selling
[10:43] a bundle at the dealership level. And
[10:47] that bundle from Variable Grid includes
[10:50] the system and also a level two charger.
[10:54] Whether you decide to go with the
[10:55] standard charger or you want to go for
[10:57] the North American standard, that's up
[11:00] to you to decide. Variable grid and Kia
[11:03] have partnered and Kia dealerships will
[11:07] be selling the variable grid system and
[11:10] a level two charger as a bundle. The
[11:13] good news is that this bundle that you
[11:15] pay for can be rolled into your lease or
[11:18] if you're financing a vehicle.
[11:20] >> Yeah. So, it goes into the monthly
[11:21] payment. So, it's great news. So,
[11:23] contact your dealer to find out more. Do
[11:25] you remember we drove this in Arizona
[11:27] for the launch? And Andrew and I both
[11:29] came away and said, you know, if you
[11:31] covered that Kia logo with a a luxury
[11:34] brand, you wouldn't be disappointed.
[11:36] This feels very upscale and luxurious.
[11:39] And there's no shiny hard plastic in
[11:41] here. Beautiful materials and
[11:43] combinations.
[11:43] >> Yeah, I really like how Kia has gone
[11:46] without high gloss piano black. We are
[11:49] done with that trend. We talk about it
[11:51] often, but this is a very modern
[11:54] interior. Lots of technology. You've got
[11:57] dual 12.3 in screen, standard wireless
[12:01] Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. Not a
[12:04] ton of buttons, but uh enough. You've
[12:07] got a volume roller. You've got your
[12:09] temperature gauges. I think that that is
[12:12] fine. You don't have everything being
[12:14] done in the screen. Storage is terrific.
[12:18] You've got a floating center console.
[12:20] This is where your wireless charging pad
[12:22] is. Now, this area where you're actually
[12:25] hiding items away isn't huge.
[12:28] >> I'll show you why in just a moment. All
[12:30] right. What about the door cards?
[12:31] >> Door cards. You can put two water
[12:33] bottles in there. But I'm surprised that
[12:35] they're not wider considering how big
[12:38] this vehicle is.
[12:39] >> Yeah. And this whole console open plan
[12:41] thing they have here is kind of why you
[12:43] get that minivan vibe. Available
[12:46] features include a heated steering
[12:48] wheel, driver seat memory, driver's
[12:51] power relaxation seat, driver bolster
[12:54] adjustment, four-way driver's lumbar
[12:57] support, front passenger power leg rest,
[13:01] second row power leg rests, 14 speaker
[13:04] Meridian premium audio system, surround
[13:06] view and blind view monitors, head-up
[13:09] display, ambient mood lighting, and
[13:11] power fold and unfold third row. Okay,
[13:14] here's me getting in the back seat. This
[13:16] is a big vehicle. You get a lot of leg
[13:19] room, a lot of headroom. The seats slide
[13:22] for and aft. Remember I told you about
[13:24] the storage area being limited in the
[13:26] front? Well, that's because they have
[13:27] this cubby that slides out from the
[13:29] front center armrest into the rear. It's
[13:32] a tray on top and underneath is another
[13:34] hidden compartment. How does it stack
[13:36] up?
[13:36] >> The EV9 gets 41.4 in of front row
[13:40] legroom and 42.8 8 in of second row
[13:43] legroom.
[13:43] >> Now, the third row isn't the biggest.
[13:46] You do have to slide the front seats
[13:47] forward. And when you get in there,
[13:49] there's just room for two people. I will
[13:51] say they are comfortable once you're in
[13:53] there, and they have a power feature.
[13:55] Means you can actually recline the third
[13:57] row.
[13:58] >> With the bench seat, third row legroom
[14:00] is 30.8 in. With captain's chairs, you
[14:03] get a little more space in the third
[14:05] row, 32 in. And if you go with the
[14:08] lounge seats, a little less, 29.9 in.
[14:12] >> Lifting the power liftgate on this
[14:13] model, you don't get a huge space behind
[14:16] the third row. Underneath, that's where
[14:18] your tire repair kit is. The nice thing
[14:20] on this top GT line is that all of the
[14:23] rear seats are remotely controlled. You
[14:25] can put them down from the back all
[14:27] electronically.
[14:28] >> EV9 cargo capacity behind the second row
[14:31] is 43.5 cubic feet. Space behind the
[14:34] third row, 20.2 2 cubic feet and overall
[14:37] cargo space 81.7 cubic feet. The front
[14:41] trunk comes in at 3.2 cubic feet.
[14:44] >> All right, your questions. Let's get at
[14:46] it.
[14:46] >> Time now for questions, coffee, and
[14:48] cars.
[14:49] >> Your questions from Instagram.
[14:51] >> I have a feeling there are going to be
[14:52] some similarly impressive features to
[14:55] the Palisad in this one. The new
[14:58] Palisade does look great. And you're
[15:01] right, there are similar features. The
[15:04] Hyundai group has really upped their
[15:07] game.
[15:07] >> For example, one thing you have the
[15:09] lounge chair in the front here. So, if
[15:11] you're parked up and you're charging,
[15:13] you can recline with the lounge chair.
[15:16] It's just big and comfortable. They need
[15:18] they know how to do big comfortable
[15:19] cars. Interestingly enough, the Palisad
[15:22] on that top trim has Nappa leather
[15:24] interior, but the EV9 was Kia's first
[15:28] vehicle to go with the um sustainability
[15:32] strategy where they are eliminating
[15:34] leather. So, this is leatherrett and it
[15:37] feels quite good. EV9 is the best three
[15:40] row EV on the market today. I was
[15:42] genuinely impressed with it after the
[15:44] Montreal Auto Show this year. I wish Kia
[15:47] will make a hybrid variant with the same
[15:50] unbeatable luxury features in this
[15:53] segment.
[15:53] >> Well, if you think about it, uh,
[15:55] Palisade, we just talked about that from
[15:56] Hyundai, has a hybrid coming this fall
[16:00] for that large three row SUV, and it
[16:02] shares the same platform as Telluride.
[16:05] It's going to happen. Tellide will get a
[16:07] hybrid. So, your wish will be granted. I
[16:09] think maybe you're wondering about a
[16:10] plugin, but they're going to have
[16:11] >> No, it sounds like a hybrid, but uh I
[16:14] was just going to say your answer is
[16:16] tellide.
[16:17] >> If you want to get a question in for a
[16:19] future video, don't be shy. Follow along
[16:21] on Instagram. It's motormouth_andrea
[16:23] to also see what's going on behind the
[16:25] scenes. For me, it's motormouth and the
[16:28] links are below the like button. Can
[16:30] these all-wheel drive models actually
[16:32] tow over 5,000 lb up to 5,000 lb with
[16:38] the right packaging on the vehicle. But
[16:41] the problem with EVs and towing is that
[16:44] you use up a lot of range quickly.
[16:47] >> Okay, this size of vehicle, they're all
[16:49] pretty much the gas models rated for
[16:52] 5,000 lb. There's a few outliers there
[16:54] like Durango can do 7,700 lb, but 5,000
[16:58] is the norm for this size.
[17:00] >> Okay, we're going to get into all of the
[17:01] vital stats of the EV9.
[17:04] >> Let's start with pricing. We'll do
[17:05] Canada first and then we'll move on to
[17:07] the US. Pricing includes freight, PDI,
[17:10] and fees. The base rearwheel drive model
[17:12] starts at just over $63,000
[17:15] and the top GT all-wheel drive is just
[17:18] under $885,000.
[17:21] In the US, the base rearwheel drive
[17:23] model starts at just under $56,000.
[17:26] And the top trim GT line all-wheel drive
[17:29] is just under 72,000.
[17:31] >> The EV9 has an 800vt architecture with a
[17:35] North American charging standard and
[17:37] also a 10.9 kW onboard charger. With a
[17:40] level two charger, it'll charge from 10
[17:43] to 80% in 9 hours depending on the
[17:46] battery size. With a DC fast charger and
[17:49] speeds up to 350 kW, it'll charge from
[17:52] 20 to 80% in 24 minutes. Rearwheel drive
[17:56] models, when properly equipped, can tow
[17:57] 2,000 lb, and all-wheel drive models up
[17:59] to 5,000 lb. The warranty is 5 years,
[18:03] 100,000 km in Canada. In the US, it's 10
[18:06] years or 100,000 mi. Lightning round.
[18:09] Two things we like. Two things we like
[18:10] to see improved.
[18:11] >> I really like how comfortable this EV
[18:14] is. This is a big loungey luxury feeling
[18:17] kind of vehicle.
[18:18] >> What I'd like to see are more bench seat
[18:20] options because if you go with the
[18:22] captain's chairs, it's just six
[18:23] passenger. May not work for everyone.
[18:25] >> We know doesn't work for me every time
[18:27] is the door handles. It doesn't like me,
[18:29] the door handles. I like regular door
[18:32] handles. There you go. EV company Kia.
[18:35] That's it. What do you guys think of the
[18:37] EV9?
[18:37] >> Thanks for watching and if you like what
[18:39] you see, subscribe. We'll see you next
[18:41] time.
