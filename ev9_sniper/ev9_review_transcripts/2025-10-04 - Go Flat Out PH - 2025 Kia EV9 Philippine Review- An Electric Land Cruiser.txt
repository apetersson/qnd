[00:03] So, here in the Philippines, we really
[00:05] do love our three row full-size SUVs,
[00:09] Toyota Land Cruiser, Nissan Patrol. And
[00:12] the question now is though, is there a
[00:14] room here in the Philippines for a three
[00:16] row electric SUV? That is exactly what
[00:18] we're going to be finding out in the
[00:20] review of the Kia EV9.
[00:23] More on that later.
[00:25] for now. If you like what you're seeing
[00:28] or even these kinds of reviews, why not
[00:31] hit subscribe and hit the bell?
[00:43] Woohoo!
[00:45] What a car. What a car this thing.
[00:51] [Music]
[00:59] So the Kia EVA is pretty much a flagship
[01:01] of Kia's global vehicle lineup. And
[01:04] yeah, as you're going to see man, in
[01:06] terms of the way the car looks, this is
[01:07] the opposite united design language. So
[01:10] that design basically is characterized
[01:12] by a blend of very edgy lines. You also
[01:16] have your the star map LED lighting
[01:18] which gives the Kia EV9 a very distinct
[01:21] look. You have your nice cuts and
[01:23] creases which does help in making the
[01:25] car side profile look less blocky and
[01:28] much sleeker. I also like here the car's
[01:31] 21in wheels. So to this actually one of
[01:34] my favorite design highlights of this
[01:35] car because let's be honest, it really
[01:37] does look distinct 21in wheels and we're
[01:41] going to talk about this later. digital
[01:44] side view mirrors and then as we move
[01:46] towards here rear portion you have this
[01:49] interesting LED taillight design which
[01:52] also carries a star map pattern and then
[01:54] being the GT line vara this car gets a
[01:57] sportier front and rear bumper to
[02:00] basically match the car's added
[02:02] performance so you this car gets a dual
[02:04] motor all-whe drive layout so just
[02:06] imagine the power this thing makes
[02:08] especially when we take this car out on
[02:10] the highway now with that in And that is
[02:13] a good time, I think, for us to hop
[02:15] inside the Kia EV9 to see what else this
[02:18] car has to offer.
[02:24] So, Kia EV9 for this SUV to stand out.
[02:29] Well, as you're going to be seeing in
[02:31] the car's interior, you have this
[02:33] predominantly horizontal dash design.
[02:35] So, it looks really nice, very modern.
[02:38] And in typical Kia fashion, especially
[02:40] at this price point, the interiors
[02:42] wellmade. So the materials are very
[02:45] premium. Here in the center console,
[02:47] you're going to be seeing par
[02:49] sustainably sourced textile, which looks
[02:52] really nice and really helps in
[02:53] uplifting the vibe of this EV9's
[02:56] interior. So overall, it looks pretty
[02:58] much like a lounging interior,
[03:00] especially with all the shapes and how
[03:02] this interior has been carved out.
[03:10] So being an EV, of course, drive shaft
[03:13] tunnel and so there's this large space
[03:15] here in between the car center console
[03:18] and the car's dashboard. As you go
[03:21] through the lower parts of the car's
[03:22] interior,
[03:24] there's a lot of scratchy hard plastics.
[03:26] But then again, you have to remember now
[03:28] this is still a Kia, not exactly a Lexus
[03:30] or a BMW. Then again, BMWA, speaking of
[03:33] which, or even Audi, uh, the new X3 for
[03:36] example, or even the Q6 RON comes with
[03:38] hard touch plastics and the lower parts
[03:40] of their cars interior. So, there's that
[03:42] part as well. It's not like BMW and Audi
[03:44] at this point has a huge advantage in
[03:46] terms of interior feel and quality. But
[03:50] here in the EV9, as you're going to be
[03:52] seeing, you have these two 12.3 in
[03:54] screens running the latest CCNC or
[03:57] connected car navigation cockpit
[03:59] operating system. And so therefore, this
[04:01] is still pretty much familiar. So if
[04:03] you've seen my reviews of the Kia Sento,
[04:05] the Hyundai Tucson, the Hyundai Santa
[04:07] Fe, this interface will be pretty much
[04:10] familiar to you. And as you would
[04:11] expect, uh the interface is very simple
[04:14] and easy to operate. You also have
[04:16] wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto
[04:18] along with other premium features here,
[04:21] which worth mentioning, Apple, these
[04:24] lovely GT line seats. They're very nice.
[04:26] And one of those premium features of
[04:28] course worth mentioning are the
[04:30] massaging front seats and actually even
[04:32] the rear captain's chairs as you're
[04:34] going to be seeing later. You also have
[04:35] heated and cooled front seats along with
[04:38] a lovely Meridian surround sound system.
[04:41] Actually to it is actually one of the
[04:43] best sound systems at its price point.
[04:45] So it's really comparable I think with
[04:48] the Mark Lemonson and Lexus or the
[04:50] Powers and Willings and Volvos. It's a
[04:52] really nice sound system which perfectly
[04:54] matches with the car's 64 color ambient
[04:57] lighting in boosting the interior vibe
[04:59] of the Kia EV9.
[05:03] Now speaking of tech, there's actually
[05:05] one tech feature that appreciate at any
[05:08] point during my drive and yeah these are
[05:11] basically the car's digital side view
[05:14] mirrors. So basically in le of those
[05:16] traditional mirrors the reflective um
[05:18] yeah they opted for these screens
[05:20] feeling now well it's going to make the
[05:22] car more modern but in reality you're
[05:24] not able to adjust your vision. So even
[05:28] if you adjust your head position while
[05:30] you're driving it's not going to change
[05:31] the view of the screen. So it's really
[05:35] weird. I really am not loving these
[05:39] digital side view mirrors. You also have
[05:41] to remember of course that whenever you
[05:42] look at the rear view mirror your eyes
[05:44] will tend to adjust peripheral or depth
[05:47] perception and then when you glance
[05:49] towards these mirrors just imagine
[05:52] depth perception basically. So yeah it's
[05:55] a bit disconcerting mean especially when
[05:57] you're in tight spaces and reversing
[06:00] back into a parking space. So yeah
[06:02] basically for me this is just tech for
[06:04] tech's sake. And then yeah, digital
[06:06] mirrors aside, let us now hop in the
[06:08] rear seats of the Kia EV9 which are
[06:11] going to be seeing here. Uh this front
[06:14] seat bar is set for my driving position.
[06:16] So this is similar to the driver's seat.
[06:19] And yeah, look at this leg room. Again,
[06:22] this is a three row large SUV, so you
[06:24] pretty much expect this much leg room.
[06:27] Headroom is also really good. So,
[06:30] headroom and being a premium SUV. So,
[06:34] you have power adjustable captain's
[06:36] chairs.
[06:38] And if we're going to be seeing here
[06:39] sang center armrest, you actually have
[06:42] controls here for the car's massaging
[06:44] and vibration. Yeah, I don't know why
[06:47] you have vibration functions for the
[06:49] captain's chairs, but yeah, there's that
[06:52] part. And then if you press this button
[06:54] here,
[06:59] Yeah. So, the front seat would move
[07:01] forward.
[07:09] Yeah. So, I have my footrest here. It's
[07:16] Yeah. This is a perfect lounge position
[07:20] here in the back of the Kia EV9, but I
[07:23] still have a car to review. So,
[07:26] atento.
[07:31] Yeah, that's really a lot of space here
[07:32] at the back of the Kia EV9. Now,
[07:35] speaking of the back seats,
[07:38] if I press this button here.
[07:46] Yeah. So,
[07:50] the front seat will move automatically.
[07:55] Yeah. Of course, being a full-size three
[07:58] row electric SUV, you actually have a
[08:00] lot of space here. The back of the Kia
[08:02] EV9. Now, in terms of leg room, yeah,
[08:06] with this second row seat all the way
[08:08] back, leg room, but of course, since
[08:11] these are captain's chairs, you have
[08:13] this center aisle. So, you can put your
[08:16] uh right knee here or basically your
[08:17] left knee if you're seated at this seat.
[08:20] And then of course you can bargain man
[08:21] for a bit of uh leg space with a second
[08:25] row occupant. And when they do move
[08:27] their seat a bit forward there is
[08:29] actually a good amount of space here at
[08:31] the back of the Kia EV9. And worth
[08:34] mentioning are these power adjustable
[08:36] rear seats.
[08:38] Yeah. So this really does help in making
[08:41] the third row more comfortable. Yeah. As
[08:44] for features, what you have here is your
[08:46] own uh rear lights and then you have a
[08:49] USBC fast charge port here. And you also
[08:53] have two cup holders on each side of the
[08:55] EV9's third row. Yeah. So, it's a pretty
[08:59] good third row. Actually, one of the
[09:01] most spacious third rows, I think,
[09:02] because of its bespoke EV architecture.
[09:05] And so, with that in mind, let us talk
[09:08] about the car's cargo area. Because
[09:10] since power adjustable second and third
[09:12] row seats, you can actually press a
[09:14] button cargo area to fold all of these
[09:18] seats automatically. So you have no
[09:20] levers and pulley to deal with when
[09:22] you're aiming to achieve a flat cargo
[09:24] area. And of course, being a groundup
[09:27] EV, you also have your trunk. Now, with
[09:30] all of these things out of the way, let
[09:32] us now talk about the car's powertrain
[09:35] as well as the EV9's driving experience.
[09:38] So as mentioned what you get here in the
[09:40] EV9 are dual electric motors which has a
[09:44] total system output of 384 horsepower
[09:48] and 700 Newton m of torque.
[09:51] Now that is good enough for a 0 to 100
[09:54] kph time of just 5.2 seconds.
[09:59] [Music]
[10:04] It also has a 99.84 84 kWh battery.
[10:07] While thanks to its 800vt architecture,
[10:10] the EV9 GT10 supports up to 350 kW of DC
[10:14] fast charging capabilities.
[10:17] And of course, there is also vehicle to
[10:19] load. Now, with all of these things out
[10:22] of the way, how does a Kia EV9 GTline
[10:25] perform on the open road?
[10:29] [Music]
[10:32] Now, as for the driving experience of
[10:34] the Kia EV9, well, as you would pretty
[10:37] much expect in an EV, the car is very
[10:40] quiet, very serene. I couldn't emphasize
[10:43] this enough because here in the EV9
[10:46] being Kia's flagship, Mong quiet
[10:50] compared to cars like the Yday Aionic 5
[10:52] and even the Kia EV6. To be fair, you
[10:55] car, really quiet at their price point.
[10:59] This takes a refinement level up a
[11:01] notch. In fact, you're nearly at the
[11:03] level of cars like the BMW X5 German
[11:08] luxury cars. You have to remember then
[11:10] as well being an EV with a bespoke EV
[11:13] architecture. So you have all of those
[11:15] batteries 9 kWh battery filling up the
[11:20] floor of the car. And so just imagine
[11:21] how rigid, how strong the floor air of
[11:25] the car is. And so whenever going to go
[11:27] over bumps,
[11:31] deal with the road imperfections.
[11:34] Granted, now with the car's 21in wheels,
[11:37] there's a bit of jitter like
[11:40] you would feel tiny vibrations entering
[11:44] through like the chassis. You have to
[11:46] remember for the sole fact that this car
[11:47] is so rigid
[11:51] like you just feel those as vibrations
[11:53] basically and dealing with the bumps
[11:56] like even the big ones like in C5 for
[11:58] example.
[12:00] right absorption. Couple that with this
[12:02] car's rock solid chassis, and there is
[12:05] no flexing, there is no shimming,
[12:08] there's no uh shaking whatsoever. That
[12:11] is what ultimately, at least for me,
[12:14] dictates how premium a car can feel
[12:17] chassis flex because after all, that is
[12:19] how German cars are built man. So that's
[12:22] the reason why those cars tend to feel
[12:24] so premium. And here in the Kia EV9,
[12:28] yeah, this actually taken up a notch.
[12:33] Now, this is a longrange EV, of course,
[12:35] Kia EV9. And we're taking this to a road
[12:38] trip to Subi and currently I'm battery
[12:41] charge is 71% or that is good for 382 km
[12:46] per coming from our house with the car
[12:49] fully charged s home charger. um we left
[12:52] off basic at 100% and that is good
[12:54] enough for a 530 km driving distance.
[12:57] But when you take into account energy
[13:00] consumption, so over the past 5 days or
[13:03] so that I've been driving this car, my
[13:05] average energy consumption is at around
[13:07] 4.4 km per kilowatt hour as stated here,
[13:10] which is pretty good considering how big
[13:12] this car is and also how powerful this
[13:15] car is with two electric motors. And
[13:17] then of course while we're here on the
[13:19] highway, it's a good time that I talk
[13:20] about the car's advanced driver
[13:22] assistance systems branded as drive wise
[13:24] here in these Kia cars. Now what you get
[13:27] here is of course automatic emergency
[13:29] braking along with full speed adaptive
[13:31] cruise control, lane departure warning
[13:33] and of course lane centering along with
[13:35] blind spot warning and rear cross
[13:37] traffic alert. Going back to the driver
[13:40] assistance stuff though, um let us dwell
[13:43] for a moment digital side view mirrors.
[13:45] So yeah, I've been living with this car
[13:48] for about 5 days now. And yeah, so I am
[13:51] still not a fan of these things because
[13:54] even if you crane up your neck like
[13:55] that, you won't change your POV with
[13:58] these digital side view mirrors. And so
[14:01] yeah, this is really tech for tech sake
[14:04] lang. Supposedly, it improves its range
[14:06] per that is pretty much negligible at
[14:09] this point, I'm sure, because otherwise
[14:11] Kia would have stated a different range
[14:14] figure for the Kia EV9 with and without
[14:16] the digital side view mirrors.
[14:19] [Music]
[14:24] Now, as you're driving in these everyday
[14:26] normal roads, the Kia EV9 continues to
[14:29] excel because as mentioned, N canina,
[14:31] the ride out of this thing is really
[14:33] good, really absorbent with body control
[14:37] taken into account as well because
[14:38] sometimes when the car is too soft, you
[14:41] end up with a wallowy ride. So, there's
[14:43] basically secondary motions after
[14:45] hitting a bump. But here in the Kia EV9,
[14:48] Kia has done a really good job with body
[14:50] control, which means now here in these
[14:53] kinds of roads, which are a bit twisty,
[14:56] this three row SUV is holding onto its
[14:59] own really well. So outside the BMW X7,
[15:03] this is probably as much fun. Yeah, I'm
[15:06] really actually going to say that. But
[15:08] the Kia EV9 GT line is quite capable,
[15:12] quite athletic here in these kinds of
[15:14] roads. And that's because uh outside the
[15:17] BMW X7 and even the Porsche Cayena again
[15:20] though.
[15:22] But the reason why I'm mentioning those
[15:24] cars is because this car corners really
[15:27] well. Of course, it's a large vehicle,
[15:30] but as far as large vehicles go,
[15:33] road holding capabilities because of
[15:36] course of those large batteries keeping
[15:38] the center of gravity very low compared
[15:41] to cars like for example the Toyota Land
[15:43] Cruiser or even the Nissan Patrol. Those
[15:46] cars are pretty much almost equivalent
[15:48] with the Kia EV9 in terms of size. And
[15:51] yet somehow this car hugs the road much
[15:54] better. contributing factor of course
[15:56] dual motor all-wheel drive and you know
[15:59] with the car's lower center of gravity
[16:01] because of all of those batteries it
[16:03] really helps the Kia EV9 hug this road
[16:06] pretty well thereby providing this car
[16:08] with a lot of grip now siguro in terms
[16:11] of the emotional connection man um yes
[16:14] this car is athletic
[16:16] handling but while the steering is
[16:18] actually responsive I like how
[16:20] responsive the steering is
[16:23] in terms of feedback
[16:25] completely numb, but
[16:27] offer a lot of steering feel to give you
[16:30] tactile information on what's happening
[16:32] to the front wheels. But on the upside,
[16:34] it's surprisingly precise with a good
[16:37] amount of weight. Too light. I actually
[16:40] find it well weighted.
[16:43] The Kia E9 is pretty much one of the
[16:45] only few throw electric SUVs here in the
[16:48] segment. As you're seeing, it is dealing
[16:50] with these twisty roads really well.
[16:54] [Music]
[16:56] Granted, this is not a light car though,
[16:58] but what matters the most cuz is how
[17:01] that weight is distributed all over the
[17:02] car structure. And of course, in an
[17:04] electric car, all of that weight is kept
[17:07] very low, thus helping the Kia EV9 steer
[17:10] through corners really well despite its
[17:12] heft. Of course, we're talking about is
[17:14] its dual electric motors because in this
[17:16] is a dual motor GT line variant. So, as
[17:20] expected when I put my foot down,
[17:24] [Music]
[17:26] yeah, that feels really nice. Of course,
[17:29] as expected, very instant, very
[17:31] responsive throttle input. And what I
[17:35] found out with the electric motors is
[17:36] that when you plant your foot down
[17:39] outside sport mode, it sort of induces a
[17:41] bit of smoothness without the power
[17:44] delivered. In sport mode, it pretty much
[17:47] feels like your Tesla EV. It's going to
[17:49] deliver all of that power in one full
[17:52] instant, but outside sport mode, it's
[17:55] inducing a bit of tapering power
[17:58] delivery. And so therefore, it's keeping
[18:00] the vehicle composed and smooth, even if
[18:03] you're making abrupt throttle inputs,
[18:05] thereby making the Kia EV9 very smooth
[18:09] and easy to control and easy to
[18:11] modulate.
[18:17] Finally, as for the other parts of the
[18:19] Kia EV9, well, it's all about the brakes
[18:21] because as usual with an EV, you have to
[18:24] blend both the generative braking and
[18:27] the friction brakes. And as usual with
[18:30] Hyundai Motor Groups, EVs like of course
[18:32] the Ioni 5, the Ionic 6, the Kia EV6.
[18:36] Basically, the whole arsenal of EVs, NI,
[18:38] Hyundai, and Kia that is based on the
[18:40] EGMP platform, they tend to have really
[18:44] nice controls. The brakes feel good. I
[18:47] also like I can adjust the regen to the
[18:49] paddle shifters, of course. That's what
[18:52] you would expect in a Hyundai Motor
[18:53] Group EV. So yeah, this car is easy to
[18:56] drive, easy to manage, very comfortable,
[18:59] very refined, and with a degree of
[19:02] athleticism, you wouldn't expect in such
[19:04] a large car like the Kia EV9. Would I
[19:07] say it's sporty? I think my term would
[19:09] be or my description would be that the
[19:11] Kia EV9 is athletic yet very comfortable
[19:15] and remains silently in the background,
[19:17] making this three row electric SUV a
[19:19] perfect vehicle for those who either
[19:21] want to sit at the back and be treated
[19:23] like a VIP or to those who want to drive
[19:26] their family. And while they're doing
[19:28] so, they're still having quite a lot of
[19:30] fun behind the wheel of the Kia EV9.
[19:34] Yeah, the Kia EV9, however, is far from
[19:37] being an affordable vehicle.
[19:39] Costing nearly 6 million pesos, it
[19:42] pretty much matches a Toyota Land
[19:43] Cruiser 300.
[19:45] Initially,
[19:47] EV9 segment, we thought that its price
[19:50] was expensive,
[19:53] but now in 2025, Hyundai has just
[19:57] launched the Ioni 9, which costs 1.5
[20:00] million pesos less. Don't forget, of
[20:03] course, that you also have the Chinese
[20:05] electric three row SUVs, which cost even
[20:08] less.
[20:09] That basically leaves us with the Kia
[20:11] EV9, which though it is a great three
[20:14] row electric SUV, it is one that I think
[20:17] is now too expensive relative to its
[20:19] segment.
[20:23] [Music]
