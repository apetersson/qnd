[00:00] SPEAKER: Those three-row
EVs that you've
[00:02] been waiting for have arrived.
[00:06] [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:09] And now that they're here, you
finally got some good options.
[00:13] You could go with the
luxurious design-forward Swede
[00:16] with the minimalist
interior, or perhaps
[00:19] the groovy retro-future
electric bus
[00:21] with all the personality
in the world.
[00:24] Or perhaps you just shouldn't
complicate things and just
[00:27] go with our favorite, the techy,
comfortable, not to mention
[00:30] award-winning Kia EV9.
[00:32] So today, we're going to take
you through the good and bad
[00:36] of each of these electric SUVs.
[00:39] I'm very awkwardly
sitting right now.
[00:41] My legs are out like this.
[00:44] And of course, we're going
to show all that stuff
[00:46] that you can't find out from
a Google search or a day
[00:49] at the dealership.
[00:50] And of course, they've all been
on the world-famous Edmunds EV
[00:54] Range Test because here at
Edmunds, we test everything.
[00:57] Are you ready?
[00:58] Before we get into all
of that, please like
[01:00] and subscribe so we can keep
making videos like this one.
[01:03] And for more information
on any of these vehicles
[01:05] and any other new
or used vehicle,
[01:08] head over to edmunds.com.
[01:11] Now, we know that EV9
really well, and we love it.
[01:15] This vehicle is part of the
Edmunds Year-Long Road Test
[01:18] fleet.
[01:18] So our whole staff
has driven it,
[01:20] and it serves as a great
benchmark for these other two
[01:22] vehicles.
[01:23] We're going to see what
they can do better,
[01:25] what they might do worse.
[01:26] But one thing is for sure
neither of them can do this.
[01:29] And stop.
[01:32] That's perfect.
[01:34] That smart parking
feature is cool,
[01:36] but we found the EV9
to be pretty great when
[01:39] you're driving it from inside
of the vehicle as well.
[01:42] Acceleration is good
with plenty of power.
[01:45] And although it can occasionally
feel a little too soft
[01:47] on the road, it makes
the ride smooth,
[01:50] and you still feel like you have
good control of the vehicle.
[01:53] And yes, the driver
assists are also
[01:56] great with super high-res
cameras for parking
[01:59] and blind spot monitors.
[02:00] And on the highway, it
stayed centered in its lane
[02:03] and could even change
lanes for me on its own.
[02:05] But as anyone who's owned a
three-row SUV will tell you,
[02:09] it's all about the interior.
[02:12] There is a lot to
like about this cabin.
[02:15] But, man, I love
these headrests.
[02:18] The mesh is super
supportive and breathable.
[02:21] And they're an indicator of how
much attention to detail Kia
[02:24] has paid to this interior.
[02:26] Everything from
the attention paid
[02:28] to the small-but-meaningful
details
[02:30] to these great materials
and just the overall design,
[02:33] look, and feel, this
is a luxury-grade cabin
[02:37] that you're getting in
something with a Kia badge.
[02:39] The front of the EV9 is
great for small item storage.
[02:42] You get a big bin down
there and this flexible area
[02:44] right here, where you
can store smaller items.
[02:47] And then when you need it to be,
you can pop these things out.
[02:49] And then you have two
cup holders, one of which
[02:51] is even big enough to fit
this big water bottle.
[02:53] Now, this cup,
this will also fit
[02:55] into the cup holders in both
the second and the third rows.
[02:58] There is a great blend of
physical buttons and controls
[03:01] on this interior,
so you're not overly
[03:04] reliant on this touchscreen.
[03:05] However, what's in the
touchscreen we really like.
[03:07] It's got a simple menu structure
and standard wireless Android
[03:11] Auto and Apple CarPlay--
[03:12] great there.
[03:13] Now, the only problem
ergonomically with this interior
[03:16] is this climate control
screen, which, for some reason,
[03:19] they put right here.
[03:20] And that means that it's
blocked out by the steering
[03:22] wheel whenever you're driving.
[03:23] But thankfully, there are
redundant physical controls
[03:26] for the climate.
[03:26] So you can control fan speed,
temperature, mode all right down
[03:30] here.
[03:30] You don't actually really need
to touch that screen at all.
[03:33] I love it when a company
pays almost as much attention
[03:35] to the second row
as the first row.
[03:37] Now, these seats might
be missing the headrests,
[03:39] and they might be missing
some of the power adjustments
[03:41] like lumbar support.
[03:42] But you're getting heated and
ventilated second-row seats,
[03:45] and they contain
plenty of adjustment.
[03:47] So if I want to give room
to people in the third row
[03:49] or take all the space for
myself, I can do that.
[03:51] + other thing we really
like about this second row
[03:54] is this pull-out bin right here.
[03:55] It has a little
thing on top that's
[03:57] rubberized so things
won't slide around.
[03:59] And you can use this as a
table while you're on the go.
[04:01] And then you close it up, and
you have a nice storage bin here
[04:04] for second-row passengers.
[04:05] And of course,
since this is a Kia,
[04:07] you're going to get a
USB port for every seat
[04:10] in the six-seater versions,
like the ones that we have here.
[04:12] If you want a
bench, you're going
[04:13] to have to go to one of
the lower trim levels.
[04:15] So you can seat six or seven.
[04:17] Now, before I drag my
adult-sized posterior
[04:20] into that third row, there
are a couple different ways
[04:22] that I can get back there.
[04:23] One, I can just climb right
through the captain's chairs
[04:25] right here.
[04:26] Or two, this seat
has a power release.
[04:28] So I just press a button, and
then you can climb in that way
[04:30] through the door.
[04:31] Now, here I am in the third row
for the patent-pending three
[04:34] Brians test.
[04:35] This driver's seat in
the second row seat
[04:37] are set up to where
I'm comfortable.
[04:38] And I'm just under 6 feet tall.
[04:40] And as you can see, I still
have legroom to fit back here.
[04:43] So it passes.
[04:43] And the other thing
that I like-- there's
[04:45] plenty of room under this
seat to fit your feet.
[04:47] So you don't have to
jam them in somewhere.
[04:49] Other things we like
about this third row-- you
[04:51] actually have a few
different recline settings
[04:52] for the third row.
[04:53] So you can get comfortable.
[04:54] You've got a big window
so you won't get carsick.
[04:56] And the air vents
are in the ceiling,
[04:58] right where they belong.
[04:59] On paper, the EV9 has the most
cargo room behind its third row.
[05:03] And it was able to fit
three out of our four bags.
[05:06] We'll see how the other ones do.
[05:07] Underneath, not much storage.
[05:09] And the load-in height
is kind of high,
[05:11] so heavy items might
be hard to get up here.
[05:14] Now, the thing that we do
like about this cargo area
[05:16] is that on the right side,
there are two switches so
[05:19] that you can lower the
second-row seats as well.
[05:22] So from the back
hatch here, you can
[05:24] lower both the third
and second rows
[05:28] And now it's time
to talk about value.
[05:31] This GT Line model here is
admittedly very expensive
[05:35] for a Kia.
[05:36] But with the build quality,
with how quiet the cabin is
[05:39] on the road, and with
generally how many features
[05:42] you're getting, it still feels
like a decent value in every bit
[05:45] of a $75,000 SUV.
[05:48] And if you want to pay less,
the good news is with the Kia,
[05:52] it's got the lowest base price
of any of the vehicles here.
[05:55] And, yes, you're going to get
smaller wheels, less power,
[05:58] and a few less features.
[05:59] But most of the good
stuff that we showed you,
[06:02] it's present on the lower
trim models as well.
[06:05] Combined with Kia's
best-in-the-business warranty
[06:08] and free charging credits, and
it's clear that the EV9 aces
[06:12] the value test.
[06:13] So now that we've
established the Kia's
[06:15] near-luxury
credentials, it's time
[06:17] to find out what happens when
you buy a real-deal fancy car.
[06:22] [MUSIC PLAYING]
[06:26] A big part of a vehicle's
luxury credentials is serenity,
[06:30] and that is definitely
something you're going
[06:31] to get in the new Volvo EX90.
[06:34] Its cabin is super
quiet on the road.
[06:37] Multiple drivers
on staff called it
[06:39] one of the quietest cars
they've ever driven.
[06:42] And we drive a lot of cars.
[06:44] On top of that, the ride is
pretty soft and comfortable,
[06:47] considering this thing's
got giant wheels.
[06:49] But it's also
still stable if you
[06:52] need to make an
emergency maneuver
[06:53] or find yourself
on a twisty road.
[06:56] The driver assists,
however, are not so good.
[06:59] Our pal Clint was driving
this thing last week
[07:01] and mentioned multiple times
when the systems would just
[07:04] cut out.
[07:05] Volvo promises full hands-free,
autopilot level capabilities
[07:09] are on the way.
[07:10] That's why there's
this LiDAR hump
[07:12] full of sensors on the roof.
[07:13] But what's here right now
is unreliable and just bad.
[07:17] One thing, though, that
we have to point out
[07:19] is the throttle response.
[07:21] So right now, I'm driving
the EX90 in its normal mode,
[07:23] and I'm going to
hit the throttle.
[07:25] 1, 2, 3, and there
we finally go.
[07:28] There's a long delay between
when you're hitting the throttle
[07:30] and when the vehicle
actually gets moving.
[07:32] And you have to time that in
when you're driving around.
[07:35] It has over 500 horsepower,
but it doesn't really
[07:38] feel like it because of the
slowness of that response.
[07:41] However, if you put it into its
performance mode just like this,
[07:44] and then we do the same
thing, immediate power.
[07:48] And then it feels really,
really substantial.
[07:50] So if you want that
responsiveness,
[07:52] you're going to have to go
through performance mode.
[07:54] Then there's the interior.
[07:56] Now, just like the Kia,
Volvo does a great job
[07:58] with the small details, like
these little Swedish flags
[08:01] that you're going to
find on the seats.
[08:03] But I think, overall, it
is a step up than what
[08:05] you're getting in the EV9.
[08:07] It's a bit harder to find
those cheaper points.
[08:09] They're definitely
there in the Kia.
[08:10] But here in the Volvo,
they're just a little bit more
[08:13] well hidden.
[08:13] Oh, and in typical
Volvo fashion,
[08:16] these seats are
super comfortable.
[08:18] They look thin, but
don't let that fool you.
[08:19] They're really supportive.
[08:21] Now, this wool upholstery that
looks awesome and breathes
[08:23] really well-- it is a no-cost
option on this trim level.
[08:27] Nappa leather actually
comes standard.
[08:28] And if you get the leather,
unfortunately that's
[08:30] the only way to get
seat ventilation.
[08:32] When it comes to small-items
storage, not as good as the Kia.
[08:36] There is this big, large
bin area down here.
[08:39] But up here in the
center console,
[08:40] all the space is
pretty much taken up.
[08:42] So there's not as many places
to put small items and things.
[08:45] Though, I will say,
in the center console,
[08:47] it has this cool false bottom.
[08:48] So you can actually
open up the bottom here,
[08:50] and it about doubles in size.
[08:52] You can hide stuff that you
don't want people to find.
[08:54] Now, these cup holders
though-- they are quite small.
[08:56] They don't fit this
big water bottle,
[08:58] but they will fit your big, dumb
cup if you have one of those.
[09:02] Six USB-C charging
ports-- so two
[09:05] for each row-- and a
wireless charging pad
[09:07] right here that also
doubles as a spot
[09:09] where you'll put the key
to start the vehicle.
[09:11] Unfortunately, there are
some problems in here.
[09:14] First of all, taller
drivers are going
[09:15] to have a problem finding
a good driving position
[09:18] because there isn't quite enough
steering wheel adjustment.
[09:21] And every EX90 comes with
this really big glass
[09:24] roof, which looks great and lets
a lot of light into the cabin.
[09:27] And it actually does a pretty
good job managing heat.
[09:30] So unlike a Tesla, you're
not going to bake inside.
[09:32] However, midday sun will
come right through there,
[09:35] and it has a tendency to hit
the dash in just the right place
[09:38] so it shines right
into your eyes
[09:40] when you're trying to drive.
[09:41] I also really don't
like that on the doors,
[09:44] you're only seeing
two window switches.
[09:46] And that means that if you want
to control the rear windows,
[09:48] you have to hit this
touch-sensitive button,
[09:50] make sure that the rear
windows are highlighted,
[09:52] and then you can adjust them.
[09:54] This is both over
and underengineered
[09:56] at the exact same time.
[09:58] But our biggest complaint
is this touchscreen.
[10:01] And it doesn't have to do
with its operation or the way
[10:04] that it looks because
it looks great
[10:06] and is actually
quite responsive.
[10:08] The problem is they've just
crammed too much stuff into it.
[10:11] You look at this
dashboard, and you just
[10:13] wish for a few more
physical controls, like,
[10:15] for the heated seats
and for the climate.
[10:18] Instead, everything is
buried into the screen.
[10:20] And while minimalism might
be cool at the Apple Store,
[10:23] in your car, it doesn't
feel quite as good.
[10:25] Now, if we expand
the conversation
[10:27] to include tech
more broadly, things
[10:29] look even worse for the EX90.
[10:32] Over our time with it during
our rating and review process,
[10:35] it's thrown no fewer than 10
different error messages at us,
[10:39] from charging problems
to safety warnings.
[10:41] And it even through a critical
suspension error on the highway
[10:45] and limited the vehicle's
speed to 60 miles an hour.
[10:48] Now, these don't seem
to be real errors
[10:50] because each time we've
simply turned the car off,
[10:53] turned it back on, and
they've disappeared.
[10:55] So if you're looking
at this system,
[10:57] we like the Google integration,
especially Google Maps.
[11:00] And we also like the
fact that you're still
[11:01] getting Apple CarPlay, which
you can't say about all EVs.
[11:05] But simply put, the software--
it's just not there yet.
[11:09] From the second that
you get into the EX90,
[11:12] it's clear that its confines
are a lot tighter than the EV9.
[11:16] Getting in is a bit tougher.
[11:17] And as you can see, this seat
is pushed back all the way.
[11:20] It can only go
forward from here.
[11:21] So there's not nearly
as much legroom.
[11:23] But headroom is really good.
[11:25] Now, the nice thing in
the EX90 is no matter
[11:27] what trim level you get-- we're
in the top ultra trim level
[11:29] here-- you can still
get a second-row bench.
[11:32] And we like that flexibility.
[11:33] But if you want captain's
chairs, those are a $500 option.
[11:37] Now, cup holders here,
they are a problem.
[11:40] They come here in the center
seat, which folds down like so.
[11:43] But they're pretty small.
[11:44] They won't even fit our big,
dumb water bottle in either one.
[11:48] [CLATTER, CAT YOWLING]
[11:49] The third row is the weakest
part of the EX90's interior
[11:53] and it starts before
you even get back here.
[11:55] Now, if you have the
bench seat like this one,
[11:57] that means you're going to have
to climb in through the door.
[11:59] And even though these seats
tilt and slide forward,
[12:02] the opening simply
isn't big enough
[12:04] to make access back here easy.
[12:06] Once you do get back
here, it's pretty awful.
[12:09] This thing straight up
fails the three Brians test.
[12:12] I can't actually
close my legs any more
[12:13] than this because they
hit the seat backs.
[12:15] And also, there's not really
any room underneath the seats
[12:18] to put your feet.
[12:19] This would be a lot easier
if I didn't have legs
[12:21] or if I wasn't adult-sized.
[12:23] The other thing, too,
back here, the cup holders
[12:25] are even smaller than the
ones in the second row.
[12:28] So there's no way that
your cup is going to fit.
[12:30] Although I will say, I do like
the placement of the air vents,
[12:33] and that's pretty much
the only good thing I
[12:35] have to say about it back here.
[12:36] Though it has the least cargo
room behind its third row,
[12:39] on paper, the EX90
fit the same amount
[12:41] of bags behind its third
row as the EV9 did.
[12:44] And it has a much larger
underfloor storage space.
[12:47] There's also a little panel
right here where you can then
[12:49] fold down the
power-folding third row--
[12:52] the only vehicle here with that.
[12:54] Now, when it comes to overall
space behind the second row
[12:56] and behind the
first row, the EX90
[12:58] is way down compared to
the other two vehicles.
[13:01] So for moving larger
items, it's going
[13:02] to be a bit more difficult.
But this one also
[13:04] has an air suspension,
so you can lower it.
[13:07] So it's actually easier to
put heavy things in the Volvo
[13:09] than either of the
other two vehicles.
[13:11] As you might expect, the Volvo--
[13:13] it's going to cost you.
[13:15] The base version of the EX90--
[13:17] it costs $10,000 to $15,000
more than the cheapest
[13:21] all-wheel-drive versions of
both the EV9 and the ID Buzz.
[13:25] Part of the reason, though,
that this thing costs so much,
[13:27] is that you get a ton of
standard features-- premium
[13:31] paint, big wheels,
panoramic roof, Bose audio,
[13:34] heated steering wheel, head-up
display, surround-view camera.
[13:38] Those are all things
that you're going
[13:39] to have to pay more for
in the other vehicles,
[13:42] but they come on every EX90.
[13:44] You can add an air
suspension, massaging seats,
[13:47] and soft-close doors for about
$4,500 if those features are
[13:51] important to you.
[13:52] And, of course, there's
a performance upgrade.
[13:55] But at $5,000, we don't think
that is really worth it.
[13:58] The best version of the EX90
is probably the base car,
[14:02] with you just adding on the
little things that you want.
[14:04] While the EX90
certainly has potential,
[14:07] our experience with this
particular test vehicle
[14:10] left us feeling like it's
not really worth the money.
[14:13] Now, this could change.
[14:14] As with all vehicles that
are so reliant on software,
[14:17] Volvo has a chance to
figure this stuff out,
[14:19] and we hope that they do.
[14:21] OK, so now that
we've covered luxury,
[14:23] it's time to have some fun.
[14:26] [MUSIC PLAYING]
[14:29] I like driving the ID Buzz.
[14:31] Yes, it's technically
the slowest car here
[14:33] we have based on
our test results.
[14:35] But there was more
than enough grunt,
[14:36] and it's still two seconds
quicker to 60 miles an hour
[14:39] than any other minivan.
[14:41] It's also incredibly easy
to see out of this thing.
[14:44] Even with its high belt line,
these big vertical windows
[14:47] mean you can always have an
eye on the cars around you.
[14:50] I do wish that there
was a one-pedal driving
[14:52] mode like in some EVs.
[14:53] And the ride, it's
a little bit firm
[14:56] if that's something
that bothers you.
[14:57] It's also measurably noisier
compared to the other EVs,
[15:01] probably because of
its body aerodynamics
[15:03] and airy, resonant interior.
[15:05] While I was on the
highway, I learned
[15:07] the semi self-driving
tech is capable,
[15:09] and competent. it's more
consistent than the Volvo's,
[15:12] but not nearly as
effective as the Kia
[15:14] at making your life easier
through highway slogs.
[15:17] But for vehicles like these,
they could drive awesome.
[15:20] And that doesn't matter if
you don't like the interior.
[15:23] The ID Buzz is the
clear winner when
[15:25] it comes to room behind
its first and second rows.
[15:28] It's not a moon,
but it is a van.
[15:31] So it's just
absolutely cavernous.
[15:32] And it's nice that
the opening is
[15:33] a big, square,
rectangular shape as well.
[15:37] And behind the third row,
technically less cargo room
[15:39] than the Kia.
[15:40] And we were only able to fit
three of our bags back here.
[15:43] And we couldn't fit
the big bag at all.
[15:44] Although if you took
out this cargo shelf
[15:47] or dropped it down
to its lower setting,
[15:49] you could easily
fit all four bags.
[15:51] The reason that you'd want
to leave this shelf in,
[15:53] though, is that if you
fold down the third row,
[15:55] it's the only way to
get a flat cargo floor.
[15:58] So if you plan to use the
ID Buzz to camp or something
[16:01] like that, you'll have to
leave the shelf in so you
[16:03] can put in an inflatable
mattress or something else
[16:06] to be comfortable on.
[16:07] And once you make
it up front, it
[16:09] feels just as expansive
as the cargo area does.
[16:12] There's tons of headroom,
these big, wide seats,
[16:15] giant windows all around you.
[16:17] This feels so much more roomy
than the other two SUVs.
[16:20] And I can't really think
of anything else that
[16:22] feels as big as this, except for
maybe something like a Sprinter
[16:25] van.
[16:26] Now, I have to say
that the overall feel
[16:28] of the cabin and
the materials-- it
[16:30] is a step behind in what
you're getting in the Kia
[16:32] and certainly the Volvo.
[16:34] Though the seats, they do
come with available massage
[16:36] functionality, and they
are pretty comfortable even
[16:39] for long trips.
[16:40] What isn't very good is
weirdly small item storage
[16:44] for something this roomy.
[16:45] You get a pretty good
door pocket or two,
[16:47] and you have this nice shelf
here above the glove box.
[16:49] But other than
that, you're really
[16:51] stretched for
small-item storage.
[16:53] The wireless charging pad
is tucked in here right
[16:55] in front of the driver,
so there's a good spot
[16:57] to put your phone.
[16:58] But if you look around, there's
not really anything else.
[17:01] This might look
like a storage bin,
[17:03] but it's actually for the
cup holders to fold out.
[17:05] And the cup holders, they
aren't even that big.
[17:07] They'll fit your cup.
[17:08] But if you've got a big water
bottle, no frigging way.
[17:12] Technology in the ID
Buzz is kind of eh.
[17:16] In the same way
that the EX90, we
[17:17] didn't like the control scheme.
[17:19] They also tried to jam way too
much stuff into this screen
[17:22] here.
[17:22] And we also don't like the
fact that these touch-sensitive
[17:25] buttons for the temperature and
the volume control right below
[17:28] the screen--
[17:28] they don't work
very well either.
[17:31] You do wish just for
more physical controls.
[17:33] And that's becoming a
theme on modern interiors.
[17:35] And I just wish that automakers
could hear us and consumers cry
[17:39] out for more buttons.
[17:40] Now, we also have
to fault the ID Buzz
[17:42] because its window controls,
just like in the Volvo,
[17:45] are nonsensical--
[17:46] a single row of
buttons with a little
[17:48] switch you have to flip to
go between front and rear.
[17:51] This is a bad solution.
[17:52] It was bad when they
introduced it on the ID.4,
[17:55] and it's bad now.
[17:56] Now, the screen
does come standard
[17:58] with Apple CarPlay and
Android Auto, thankfully.
[18:01] So you can listen to your
favorite band with ease.
[18:04] Although there are things on
this interior that I would like
[18:06] to change, charging options
isn't one of them-- at least
[18:09] two USB-C ports available for
each row and an extra bonus
[18:13] one located up here
in the mirror housing
[18:15] to power a dash cam.
[18:17] Even though it's
pretty easy to get
[18:18] in and out of all
these vehicles,
[18:20] nothing beats a sliding door.
[18:22] And that is what really
makes the ID Buzz is
[18:23] unique among this set of SUVs.
[18:26] Now, technically, this has less
legroom on paper than the EV9.
[18:30] But I mean, nah,
that ain't the case.
[18:33] This thing is roomy
and expansive.
[18:35] You got nice, big
windows all around.
[18:37] And in a nod to the
old bus, this window,
[18:39] they even open sideways.
[18:41] Small-item storage in the
second row is also bad.
[18:44] You get some decently
sized door pockets.
[18:46] And I like this
little pouch here
[18:47] where you can put your phone.
[18:48] But other than that, there's
nowhere to put your stuff.
[18:51] And even worse, there's
nowhere to put a cup.
[18:55] That's right.
[18:55] This is a,
quote/unquote, "minivan"
[18:58] without second-row cup holders,
and that is an unforgivable sin.
[19:02] Now, you can take the center
console and drag it back here
[19:05] and click it in like so.
[19:07] And that gives you a little
bit of storage here on the back
[19:10] and on the front, but not much.
[19:11] And at most, you can take
these little dividers
[19:13] and make one cup holder
for two people to share.
[19:16] But that means they're
going to fight over it.
[19:18] And when it comes
to the third row,
[19:19] the ID Buzz is clearly
the class of this field.
[19:22] If you look on the
spec sheet, it's
[19:24] actually got more legroom in the
third row than the second row
[19:27] and in the second row
than in the first row.
[19:29] And this seat is
actually scooted
[19:31] back as far as it can be.
[19:32] And this thing would pass the
three Brians test so easily.
[19:35] We went and got Anders.
[19:37] He's 6'4.
[19:37] And he's going to move the seat
up to where he's comfortable.
[19:40] And as you can see, when he
does that, all of a sudden,
[19:42] I can almost stretch
my legs out completely.
[19:45] Now, the air vents in the
third row are in a great spot.
[19:47] You get a big window.
[19:48] But it also suffers from
the second-row problem
[19:50] of not having a good cup holder
because our cup doesn't even
[19:53] fit into that weirdly
square-shaped thingy there.
[19:56] However, it's so
roomy that we would
[19:58] say that if you're going to
put passengers in the third row
[20:00] regularly, this
is the one to get.
[20:03] The ID Buzz is either
pretty good or very bad
[20:07] on value, depending on
what you compare it to.
[20:10] If we're comparing this
against other minivans,
[20:13] it's not going to be
flattered by the comparison.
[20:16] A fully loaded Toyota Sienna
with a much nicer interior
[20:19] and a lot of features is about
$1,000 less than the base model
[20:23] of the ID Buzz.
[20:24] However, this fully
loaded Pro S Plus version
[20:28] with all-wheel drive is also
by far the cheapest vehicle
[20:32] that we have in our test today.
[20:34] So up against the other
electric three rows,
[20:37] it starts to look pretty good.
[20:38] And that's even before you
factor in the free maintenance
[20:41] and about 1,200 miles of
free charging credits.
[20:45] Now, admittedly, against
the other two vehicles,
[20:48] its cabin is not as nice.
[20:50] We didn't even come close
to dropping the L word
[20:52] while we were sitting in there.
[20:54] However, what it lacks in
luxury it makes up for in space.
[20:58] So the only real
ding when you're
[21:00] considering the ID Buzz against
its electrified competition
[21:04] is range.
[21:05] Like every electric vehicle
that comes through the Edmunds
[21:08] garage, all three of these SUVs
went on the Edmunds EV Range
[21:12] Test, which means that they
were driven on the same route,
[21:15] aiming for a 40-mile-an-hour
average speed,
[21:18] with a 60/40 city/highway split
to simulate real-world driving.
[21:22] Here's how they did.
[21:24] [MUSIC PLAYING]
[21:27] The Volvo sneaks out a win,
going 310 miles on our test,
[21:31] with the EV9 close on
its heels at 306 miles.
[21:35] But bringing up the
rear was the ID Buzz
[21:38] at just 262 miles,
which is plenty
[21:41] for daily driving,
but maybe not a lot
[21:44] if you're going to go
on long road trips.
[21:46] And very briefly, we have
to talk about charging.
[21:49] Now, each of these
vehicles has a CCS port.
[21:52] But if you go down
the line a little bit,
[21:54] they will all come with an
NACS port, AKA a Tesla port,
[21:59] so they'll be able to charge at
Tesla's super charging stations.
[22:02] In the meantime, though,
you can get an adapter
[22:04] for each of these
vehicles so you
[22:06] have access to
those stations now,
[22:07] except for in the ID Buzz,
which won't have access
[22:10] until this summer.
[22:14] So after a long day crawling
all over these things
[22:17] inside and out, here's
what we learned.
[22:20] The stylish and
luxurious Volvo EX90
[22:23] is hard to recommend because
it comes to us with software
[22:26] that seems just half-baked.
[22:28] Volvo has time to
turn this around.
[22:30] But as of now, it's
not the one that we
[22:32] would recommend of
this test unless having
[22:34] the best-looking
interior and having
[22:36] some wheels without the
manufacturer logo in the hubcap
[22:39] is really important to you.
[22:41] And then there's
the ID Buzz, which
[22:43] weirdly shares some
ergonomic and control
[22:46] issues with the Volvo.
[22:48] However, it's got two
big things going for it.
[22:51] And the first one is
simply that it's big.
[22:54] Look at it parked here
next to these other two.
[22:57] It is so imposing.
[22:59] So if you're going to
carry a lot of cargo
[23:01] or a lot of
passengers frequently,
[23:03] that might make this
your choice by default.
[23:05] And the second thing
is it looks awesome.
[23:09] I hope at least some
of you guys choose
[23:11] this one over the other
two, because whatever
[23:13] I see them going down
the road, it just
[23:15] puts a big smile on my face.
[23:17] And that brings
us to the Kia EV9.
[23:21] Now, this has the highest
overall Edmunds rating
[23:23] of the three vehicles
here for a reason.
[23:26] While there might be
small, individual things
[23:28] that the Volvo or the Volkswagen
do better than the EV9,
[23:31] neither of those vehicles
is as well-rounded.
[23:34] There are really no
drawbacks with the Kia.
[23:37] We love how comfortable it is.
[23:38] We love the interior
that you're getting.
[23:40] We love its technology.
[23:41] And we also love
the fact that it's
[23:43] just super easy to live with.
[23:45] And this remains the best
choice for most people.
[23:48] But if your needs don't
match up with the Kia,
[23:51] these two can fill in.
[23:52] Or maybe the Volvo can if you
give it another year or so.
[23:55] So which one of these
would you choose?
[23:58] Let us know in the
comments below.
[24:00] And also let us know if there's
any other questions you have
[24:02] about any of these
vehicles, or even
[24:04] if I should clone myself
to make that three Brians
[24:07] test more realistic.
[24:09] And then I won't have to host
videos with Clint anymore.
[24:12] I'll work with much
better company.
