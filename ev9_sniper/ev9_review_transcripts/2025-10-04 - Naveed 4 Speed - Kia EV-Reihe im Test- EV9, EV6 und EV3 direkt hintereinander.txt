[00:00] Hey guys, hello and welcome to Naveid
[00:02] for Speed. In today's v, you might see
[00:05] that I've got a few Kia behind me and
[00:08] that's because I'm on a Kia Drive event
[00:11] and I'm going to be driving some of
[00:13] their electric cars to show you exactly
[00:16] what they are like and to compare them
[00:18] with one another. The cars I'm going to
[00:19] be driving are the Kia EV9, the Kia EV6,
[00:23] and the Kia EV3. I'm going to be trying
[00:25] to get the GTline S version of each car.
[00:29] So that's the topsp spec version of each
[00:31] car. Now I will point out that Kia also
[00:33] make the Nero EV which is made on a
[00:35] separate platform. So I won't be driving
[00:37] that in today's video. But I'll be
[00:39] driving this. There's a Kia EV 9 over
[00:42] here. Although I won't be driving that
[00:44] particular one. I'll be driving this one
[00:46] here, GT Line S. There's the Kia EV6
[00:49] over here. And just up there, I'm not
[00:51] sure if you can see. I'll just pop the
[00:53] camera up there. There's a Kia EV3 all
[00:55] the way back there. So I'll be driving
[00:57] those. But we are going to start with
[01:00] the Kia EV9.
[01:02] So here we go. We're starting with the
[01:05] Kia EV9. This is the large 7seater SUV.
[01:11] Although the version that I have is a
[01:12] six-seater. You can get this car as a
[01:14] sevenseater and as a six-seater. If you
[01:17] get it as a six-seater, you get the
[01:19] captain chairs in the middle, which are
[01:22] quite convenient for getting children in
[01:24] and out of the car or for adults to get
[01:27] in and out of the car as well. It makes
[01:29] things a little bit easier. But yes,
[01:31] this is the large uh electric 7seat SUV.
[01:34] And of course, there aren't many
[01:36] electric 7seater cars, and that's the
[01:39] reason why this particular car, the Kia
[01:41] EV9, has won several awards. Uh it's
[01:44] been quite popular and the only issue
[01:47] with all this is the price of the car.
[01:50] This particular one that I'm driving is
[01:52] the uh GTline S. So it's the top spec
[01:56] and it costs around £77,000
[01:59] as tested the one that I have. So it is
[02:02] quite pricey and you've got to remember
[02:05] if you're paying that much money the
[02:07] badge that you're getting is a Kia. Now
[02:09] don't get me wrong, recently Kia have
[02:12] started to find a really good form. So
[02:15] have Hyundai and Genesis. Of course,
[02:17] these cars borrow uh you know the the
[02:20] the underpinnings from each other, but
[02:23] the Kia vehicles have started to get
[02:24] better and better, especially their
[02:26] electric cars. But one thing that I find
[02:29] quite surprising about this car, as soon
[02:31] as I get into the car, it's how smooth
[02:34] it is. You've got to remember this car
[02:36] is it weighs over 2 1/2 tons uh curb
[02:40] weight and it has so much power. Uh
[02:44] we're talking just under 400 uh brake
[02:46] horsepower. I think it's around around
[02:48] 380 brake horsepower. Uh 700 new m of
[02:52] torque in this version as well. It's got
[02:54] a large uh around 98 kWh battery. So,
[02:58] it's got the capacity, it's got the
[03:00] weight, it's got the power, but when
[03:03] you're driving it, you can really get a
[03:05] move on like this. And quite often, I
[03:08] find myself driving the Kia EV9, which
[03:12] I've driven before, and I think to
[03:13] myself, this car does not have any
[03:15] business going this fast because it is a
[03:18] big car. It looks big, it feels big, but
[03:21] the way that it drives, it doesn't feel
[03:24] big. It's when you're maneuvering it
[03:26] about. It's a five meter long car. It is
[03:28] big and there's loads of capacity in the
[03:31] car. You've got loads of boot space if
[03:33] you put the rear bench of seats down and
[03:35] it's just a convenient allrounder car.
[03:38] If this is what you need, if you need
[03:40] the extra seats, if you need the extra
[03:42] luggage capacity in an electric car,
[03:45] then the Kia EV9 is absolutely
[03:48] brilliant. I just have those issues
[03:50] about the badge and the price. And of
[03:53] course, the badge. We're going to see
[03:55] that throughout all the three vehicles
[03:57] that I'm driving today. But yeah, I um I
[04:01] do like being in a large car that can uh
[04:04] that can shift this. Well,
[04:09] so up next in my day of exploring Kia
[04:13] electric vehicles, I've got the Kia EV6.
[04:17] Now, the Kia EV6 has recently had a
[04:20] facelift, and this is one of those
[04:21] facelift versions of the car. I think
[04:24] the front end of the car has been
[04:26] totally transformed. It wasn't a badl
[04:28] looking car in the first place, but I
[04:29] think it just looks that little bit
[04:31] better. Now, you will remember if you
[04:33] watch some of my previous videos that I
[04:35] took a Kia EV6 on a road trip to
[04:38] Cornwall, and on the way I showed a
[04:41] little bit about how I charged the car
[04:43] using Instavolt chargers, etc., etc.,
[04:46] But the one thing that I could mention
[04:50] and I could remember about that car
[04:52] during that video was the fact that it
[04:54] was really comfortable. The long journey
[04:57] was just so easy and it just felt like a
[05:01] car that's
[05:03] at home being on the motorway, being on
[05:06] longer journeys, which of course is
[05:08] something that people struggle with when
[05:10] it comes to electric cars. Now, the Kia
[05:12] EV6, I've seen a lot of these cars out
[05:15] on the road, and the one that I have is
[05:18] the GTline S. So, I'm trying to in this
[05:20] video show you the topsp spec versions
[05:22] of each of the cars um just because
[05:25] they're comparable that way. Uh now,
[05:27] we'll start with the price. Again, this
[05:29] particular one costs £57,000
[05:32] as tested. It's got the heat pump as
[05:34] well, so it is still quite pricey. Um,
[05:38] but I have seen a lot of these on the
[05:40] road and so clearly people are buying
[05:42] them. I'm not sure necessarily if
[05:43] they're buying them in the topsp spec,
[05:45] but the topsp spec is a nice place to
[05:47] be. You've got these comfortable seats.
[05:48] I didn't mention the seats uh the front
[05:50] seats at least in the Kia EV9, but Kia's
[05:53] seats are usually so comfortable. I like
[05:56] the fabric seats. These sort of the
[05:58] headrest area as well that's adjustable.
[06:00] Um, and in some of their cars, you can
[06:02] actually adjust the passenger seat as
[06:05] well using some buttons on the side.
[06:07] that's not the case in this particular
[06:08] car. Um, but yeah, I mean, otherwise
[06:11] they kind of feel a little bit similar
[06:14] to drive. I think the Kia EV3, which I'm
[06:16] going to drive a little bit later in
[06:18] this video, is slightly different
[06:19] compared to the other two, the six and
[06:21] the 9. But the 6 and the 9 do quite feel
[06:24] quite similar. It is still a heavy car.
[06:26] It's just over two tons curb weight, but
[06:29] it has around 320 brake horsepower. So
[06:32] that means the 0 to 60 mph time is
[06:34] roughly the same as the Kia EV9. So it
[06:38] just goes to show that big Kia EV9, it
[06:41] has the performance to get a move on.
[06:43] But this car just feels a little bit
[06:45] more nimble. It just feels a little bit
[06:47] more flowing well on the on a road like
[06:50] this. And I think that lends itself
[06:53] really well to driving on the motorway.
[06:55] Driving around the city again, nice and
[06:58] smooth that that powertrain. I do like
[07:00] having the switch gear here in the
[07:03] center console rather than behind the
[07:05] steering wheel on a stalk like it is in
[07:07] the Kia EV9. It's just a lot more
[07:09] convenient and a little bit more
[07:11] familiar what we're used to uh when
[07:12] we're changing gear. And yeah, I think
[07:15] the Kia EV6 as an all-around car is
[07:20] I mean I was really surprised when I
[07:21] drove it the first time. It looks
[07:23] amazing. That front end looks really
[07:25] good. It looks like it could be the
[07:27] front end of a supercar. Um, and then
[07:29] the rest of it, you've got the
[07:30] practicality. You've got the seats
[07:32] behind. You've got uh I think just under
[07:34] 500 L of uh boot space with the seats
[07:37] up. Um, so there's there's a decent
[07:39] amount of practicality back there. And
[07:41] of course, again, it has the similar
[07:44] underpinnings of cars like the Hyundai
[07:47] Ionic 5 and the uh Genesis GV60. Both
[07:51] brilliant cars. This car just has its
[07:53] own little flavor. It just has its own
[07:55] uh styling. It's uh own personality and
[07:59] I think you can't go wrong with these
[08:00] cars. There's a reason why Kia have been
[08:01] winning awards and uh the EV6 is another
[08:05] good car.
[08:07] Right. So, the last of the three
[08:09] electric cars that I'm driving today,
[08:11] the Kia EV3, the smallest of the three,
[08:15] and it's the newest of the three as
[08:18] well. Now, the Kia EV3, when you look at
[08:20] it from the outside, you might think it
[08:22] looks quite familiar. It looks a lot
[08:24] like the EV9, and that's because this
[08:27] car is essentially a pint-sized Kia EV9.
[08:31] It's a smaller version. Everything
[08:32] that's good about the EV9 has been
[08:35] condensed into this smaller package.
[08:37] It's has the similar star map
[08:40] constellation uh lights on it as well,
[08:43] although so does the Kia EV6, but in a
[08:46] slightly different arrangement. This
[08:48] particular car has a similar arrangement
[08:50] to the EV9 and it just it's that sort of
[08:55] small SUV. Um, but it's supposed to
[08:58] offer uh a bit more of a urban driving
[09:01] style so you can drive it around the
[09:03] city a lot more easily. You can park it
[09:05] a little bit easier. Um, it, you know,
[09:08] it's a lot quicker to charge uh because
[09:11] it doesn't need that much uh power. I
[09:13] mean, it's got a smaller 84 kWh battery,
[09:16] I believe it is. Um, so you can charge a
[09:19] little bit quicker and you can still go
[09:22] as far as you need to in this car
[09:25] comfortably. Now, I have driven the Kia
[09:29] EV3 before. I drove it in the air
[09:31] version, the entry- level version. This
[09:33] is the GTline S. So, I managed to get
[09:37] all three cars in the GTline S uh trim
[09:40] level to show you. Um, and to be honest,
[09:43] I've got to say that I still feel like
[09:46] this EV3 drives a little bit different
[09:49] than the 6 and the 9. Uh, it just feels
[09:52] a little bit less refined than the other
[09:55] two. It just feels a little bit more
[09:56] busy out on the road when you when
[09:58] you've got the bumps and the potholes.
[10:00] Um, but when you get the speed up, it
[10:03] does feel smooth and I quite like that.
[10:07] Now, I did show you around the Kia EV3
[10:10] GTline S when I first saw the car, when
[10:13] I was first introduced to the car. And
[10:15] then when I drove the car, I showed you
[10:16] the air version. This version has these
[10:19] nice leather seats, this fabric
[10:22] headrest. It's got the middle tray table
[10:25] that you can move forward and back.
[10:27] Although, I don't know how to do that
[10:28] whilst I'm driving and I'm not going to
[10:30] mess around with that. But yeah, it's uh
[10:33] it's got, you know, a 0 to 60 time of
[10:36] around over 7 seconds. So, it's a little
[10:39] bit slower to 60. Um, but the price is
[10:44] uh around £43,000 for this particular
[10:46] version. And if you go for one of the
[10:49] entry- level versions like the air
[10:51] version, then you can get as cheap as
[10:52] like, I don't know, what £36,000. So,
[10:55] it'll come under the £40,000
[10:58] uh bracket. So, it means you can save
[11:00] some money on tax. Um, and you get a
[11:03] pretty nice electric car. Now, when this
[11:05] car came out, the first time I saw it, I
[11:08] thought it's designed really well. It's
[11:10] got some clever features like the uh
[11:12] rear windscreen wiper. Um, and you know,
[11:16] it it's a shoein for car of the year.
[11:18] and it did win car of the year, but
[11:21] since then there's been a lot of other
[11:23] small electric cars uh like the uh
[11:26] Renault 5, the BYD dolphin Surf,
[11:29] although this car is a little bit bigger
[11:31] than those. Um but those cars do
[11:34] actually execute that, you know,
[11:37] strategy really well of having a small
[11:40] electric car that's great for the city.
[11:43] So it just goes to show that even though
[11:46] you know this car came out and and did
[11:48] you know showed the way that market is
[11:51] getting quite full now it's getting
[11:52] quite saturated and there's plenty of
[11:54] choices to choose from. Um but if you
[11:58] are going to go for the Kia EV 3, you're
[12:02] going to be spending a lot more money
[12:03] than those cars because like I said it
[12:05] doesn't directly compete with those
[12:07] cars. But I think it just sits sits
[12:09] nicely above. And if you if you want to
[12:11] go one step further than just the the
[12:14] small city cars, then the Kia EV3 is a I
[12:18] think it would make a lovely allrounder.
[12:20] It's it's one of those which is great in
[12:22] the city, but when you need to stretch
[12:24] your legs a little bit out on the
[12:25] motorway, it can handle it pretty well.
[12:28] Like I say, it's a pint size EV9. It
[12:31] feels when you're out on the motorway
[12:33] more like the EV6. It's nice and smooth
[12:36] and quite nippy. There's not a lot of
[12:38] roll in the body, which uh which is
[12:41] quite good.
[12:45] And yeah, it's um I mean, what can I
[12:48] say? Kia electric cars, they've been
[12:51] executed so well. And um I I I really
[12:54] quite like them. Uh I quite like the the
[12:56] the paddles on the back of the steering
[12:58] wheel where you can uh change the amount
[13:00] of regenerative braking. Um, yeah, it's
[13:04] just I would like more electric cars to
[13:08] be like this. And there we have it,
[13:10] guys. The end of the day. I've driven
[13:12] all three cars, and this is the EV3
[13:15] right there, the EV6 that I drove right
[13:17] here behind me. Out of the three, which
[13:19] is my favorite. I really quite like the
[13:22] EV6. I don't necessarily prefer SUVs
[13:26] over hatchbacks or saloons. I like the
[13:29] sort of uh low down driving experience.
[13:31] I like the smooth, the nimleness. It
[13:34] just feels that little bit more uh agile
[13:37] on the road. I like the Kia EV6. But
[13:40] anyway, thank you very much for
[13:41] watching. I hope you enjoyed this video.
[13:43] Thank you and take
