[00:00] This is the new Hyundai Ionic 9 and it's
[00:03] a little bit like Serena Williams. You
[00:05] see, it's based on the Kia EV9. That's
[00:08] its sister car, but it's come along
[00:10] later and there's a good chance it's
[00:12] actually going to be better. Sorry about
[00:13] that, Venus, but you know it's true.
[00:14] Anyway, we're going to find out if
[00:16] that's going to be the case in this
[00:17] video. I'm Matt Watson and you're
[00:19] watching Car Wow.
[00:23] I used to be seen as a budget
[00:25] alternative to Japanese and European
[00:27] brands. 20 years ago, their bestselling
[00:29] car in Europe was the Get, which wasn't
[00:31] exactly inspiring. Since then, it has
[00:33] pushed further up market with some
[00:35] hugely popular cars like the Tucson SUV.
[00:37] But Highendai hasn't been afraid to make
[00:39] some bold decisions along the way, like
[00:41] the Ioni 5's eye-catching design. It
[00:43] looks completely different than any
[00:44] other car on the road. And this theme
[00:46] continues with the new Ionic 9. Unlike
[00:48] most flagship cars, this isn't a
[00:50] conventional electric SUV or a luxurious
[00:53] saloon. Instead, it's a practical family
[00:55] car with up to seven seats. Just like
[00:57] its sister car, the Kia EV9. But despite
[00:59] sharing the same platform, there are
[01:01] some important differences between these
[01:02] two models, including the price. This
[01:05] new Ionic 9 costs from just under
[01:06] £65,000, which is about £1,000 less than
[01:10] the cheapest Kia EV9. But comparing cars
[01:13] on their list prices isn't actual
[01:15] reality. And this is why you need to use
[01:17] CarWow. You see, the Kia EV9 has been
[01:20] out for quite a while. As a result,
[01:22] there are discounts. available on it. So
[01:24] through carw you can save £6,000 off a
[01:26] Kia EV9. This is brand new. So H
[01:28] highendai hasn't discounted it just yet
[01:30] but they might do in future and that's
[01:31] why you need to head to carw if you're
[01:33] thinking about changing your car so you
[01:35] can compare what prices are actually
[01:37] available that you will pay at a dealer.
[01:39] Now if you want to do that now you can
[01:40] just click on the pop out banner
[01:41] appearing in the top right hand corner
[01:43] of the screen. Scan the QR code on
[01:44] screen or find the link in the
[01:46] description or pin comment of this
[01:47] video. Thing is though I'm not sure
[01:49] whether I prefer the look of this or the
[01:51] Kia. The K is quite easy to like the
[01:53] look of. This is a bit more challenging
[01:55] but also more interesting. So the light
[01:57] design is really cool. So you got
[01:58] daytime running lights here with this
[02:00] pattern which is mimicked in this panel
[02:01] underneath this C3 perspect. It's not
[02:04] grill obviously. It's an electric car.
[02:05] And then you have your main headlights
[02:07] down here and you got matrix LED so they
[02:09] can blank out part of their beam. That's
[02:10] kind of cool. And then underneath here
[02:12] all like the A dash safety stuff and
[02:13] sensors is hidden away. Slight concern
[02:15] over this because it's transparent
[02:17] perspects. Is that going to get really
[02:19] scratched when you go to one of those
[02:20] quick car cleaning places and they
[02:22] they're always using like dirty sponges
[02:23] and cloths. Could get a bit messy.
[02:24] That'd be interesting to see what
[02:25] happens actually. Anyway, moving down
[02:27] the side. Allo wheel starts at 19 in
[02:29] which is going to be too small. These
[02:31] are 21s and they look good. And there's
[02:33] this weird feature here which is this
[02:35] panel there. And actually on lower spec
[02:37] versions they're black. There's
[02:39] something about this angle of the car
[02:41] sort of reminds me of another car and I
[02:43] think it's the Genesis GV80 which
[02:46] interestingly is a bit of a copy of a
[02:48] Bentley Bentega. So this is a copy of a
[02:51] copy. What do you think it looks like?
[02:53] Let me know in the comments what car
[02:54] does it remind you of. Anyway, you got
[02:56] poppy out door handles like you get on
[02:57] many electric cars to reduce drag, make
[03:00] them more efficient. And then moving
[03:01] down the back, as you can see, it's
[03:03] very, very long. This, you have this
[03:05] very interesting wraparound tail light
[03:08] design there. All that fully
[03:09] illuminates. And then there's an extra
[03:10] light down here. A bit like a rain light
[03:12] on a Formula 1 car. That's the only
[03:14] similarity to a Formula 1 car, by the
[03:15] way. Obviously, do you know what though?
[03:17] I find this angle of the car most
[03:19] challenging. Same with the Hyundai Santa
[03:21] Fe. The rear is just like, do I like it?
[03:24] Do I not? I'm not sure. The Ioni 9 is
[03:28] quite a striking looking car, but if
[03:29] you're after something with a bit more
[03:30] of a conventional looking design with
[03:32] three rows of seats, you might want to
[03:34] check out the Peugeot E50008 or the
[03:36] Mercedes EQB, but none of them have
[03:39] quite the tech of this car. So, the
[03:40] interior is dominated by this long
[03:43] screen here. Now, the graphics are quite
[03:46] dark, but they are crisp. It's
[03:47] reasonably responsive. There's quite a
[03:49] few menus which can be a bit confusing
[03:51] like why do I need things like sports
[03:53] and voice memos? But you can move things
[03:55] around to where you want them. But I do
[03:57] find that it is a little bit confusing
[03:59] trying to get into the deeper menus. You
[04:01] get there in the end, but it is a bit of
[04:02] a faf. Then you got the main digital
[04:04] drivers display. It's got a lot of
[04:05] information on it. You can cycle through
[04:07] different views and menus and lots of
[04:09] different information. And this
[04:10] particular car is fitted with a heads-up
[04:11] display as well, which is really useful
[04:13] when you're driving. There's some other
[04:14] tech as well, which I'll talk about a
[04:15] bit later on. One of the things I really
[04:17] like about this car is the drive select
[04:20] switch here. It kind of feels a bit rude
[04:22] here on the steering column. Anyway, but
[04:24] everything's right at your fingertips.
[04:27] So, drive, reverse, and the stop start
[04:29] button there as well. So, you're not
[04:31] looking around for it. It's really,
[04:32] really easy to drive. I like the fact
[04:34] that the build quality of the switches
[04:36] is really nice. So, these are things you
[04:37] use quite a lot, and they feel nicely
[04:39] damped and expensive. And overall, the
[04:41] interior quality is pretty blooming
[04:42] good. The steering wheel feels nice.
[04:44] These materials feel nice. This is soft
[04:46] like leatherrett. The sponge underneath
[04:48] the armrest is just so deep. And on
[04:51] here, it's only when you go lower down
[04:53] that things get a little bit like
[04:54] brittle, but it never feels cheap. The
[04:56] only thing that I think is a bit weird
[04:57] is the dash design. I quite like this
[04:59] stepped effect, but this coating on here
[05:02] sort of has a sticky feel to it. I
[05:04] wonder as it ages if it's going to start
[05:06] peeling off. I mean, I don't know, might
[05:08] not. One thing I do like though is that
[05:09] they haven't buried the climate control
[05:11] into the infotainment system. It's all
[05:12] easily accessible here through this
[05:14] panel. So you can just set the
[05:15] temperature dead easy and press away to
[05:17] increase the fan speed. I'd rather have
[05:18] an actual click click physical button,
[05:20] but this panel is still better than
[05:21] having to do it through there. Some of
[05:23] the things you need to know, the
[05:24] steering wheel adjustment. Yeah, it
[05:26] moves up, down, in and out, but I feel
[05:28] like it needs to come out a little bit
[05:30] further for my ideal driving position.
[05:32] Seats themselves are really comfy and
[05:33] highly adjustable as well, which is
[05:36] good. You got plenty of cubby spaces as
[05:38] well, and they're really big. So,
[05:39] underneath this armrest, look, we got
[05:41] this little tray here with a very fat
[05:43] USB cable. And more on that in a bit.
[05:46] And look at all this space under here,
[05:48] which actually goes under this part as
[05:50] well. Then we have two cup holders
[05:51] there. They're deep enough so even thin
[05:54] bottles won't rattle about too much. And
[05:55] they can hold bigger bottles as well.
[05:57] Speaking of which, the door bins are
[05:59] large. You probably noticed this. Not
[06:01] particularly on brand. Sorry, Hindi. And
[06:03] down here you have another storage tray
[06:06] as well. You got your USBs there. three
[06:08] USBC's and I like the action for the
[06:10] 12vt socket the way it's under this
[06:11] cover like that. The glove box is a
[06:13] decent enough size goes back quite far
[06:16] and we have a big vanity mirror which is
[06:19] illuminated and this particular car is
[06:21] fitted with the panoramic sunroof. The
[06:23] blind actually retracts reasonably
[06:25] quickly and the roof opens though it
[06:27] doesn't open quite as far as I'd like it
[06:28] to. You think it should go further but
[06:30] it doesn't appear to. Minor grumble
[06:32] overall though really really nice
[06:34] interior. Now, if you're wondering how
[06:35] this compares to the interior of the Kia
[06:37] EV9, they're very similar, but there are
[06:40] differences. Here's a look at the EV9's
[06:42] interior, but if you want a more
[06:43] in-depth look at it, you can just watch
[06:44] my video by clicking on the pop out
[06:46] banner there or scanning the QR code on
[06:47] screen. Now, one thing I'm not sure of,
[06:49] though, is this. What is that? Now, at
[06:52] first, I thought it might be a speaker
[06:53] behind there, but I don't think it is.
[06:54] It's just a trim piece. Why even add it?
[06:57] If you're wondering what this little
[06:58] nubb in is there, that's got the little
[06:59] sensors in which monitor your eyes to
[07:01] make sure you're paying attention and
[07:02] not like looking at the screen. The
[07:04] middle row on this car is really, really
[07:05] spacious. This one has the upgraded
[07:08] six-seater option. Costs this much
[07:10] extra. Check this out. Right, so with
[07:11] the seats all the way back, I've got
[07:12] this much knee room and loads of foot
[07:14] space. Even if I pull it all the way
[07:16] forward, look, I can still get away with
[07:18] some level of comfort. And I really like
[07:20] this as well. Look, seats recline very
[07:24] far. You can do a lot of miles in the
[07:26] middle row in this car, especially in
[07:27] this configuration. And you have like
[07:28] the armrests and everything. Look. Oh,
[07:31] lovely. And being a six-seater version,
[07:33] it's really easy to get into the back
[07:34] because you can just go through this gap
[07:36] here. Now, there are some other things I
[07:38] want to show you. So, here on this
[07:40] control panel, you can see that I've got
[07:42] seat heating on these seats and seat
[07:44] cooling and climate control as well. We
[07:47] also have a big drawer in here, which is
[07:51] handy. Plus, there's a USBC there and a
[07:53] USBC there. And if you're sat in this
[07:55] seat and you need more leg room, you can
[07:57] press a button here to move the front
[07:59] passenger seat forward. Also, we've got
[08:01] some big door bins. We got two cup
[08:04] holders here. Got the same level of
[08:05] quality here in the back as in the
[08:08] front, which is good. You got huge rear
[08:10] windows. And look, despite being huge,
[08:13] they still go all the way down. Plus, we
[08:16] have the ever handy sun shades as well.
[08:18] There's some pockets on the seat bags.
[08:20] And you can access this central cubby
[08:22] here from the back if you want. Now,
[08:24] let's get into the very back. I'm not
[08:25] going to walk through that bit cuz
[08:26] that's cheating. So, I'm going to do it
[08:29] this way to show you the mechanism.
[08:31] Right. Press a button on here. Folds
[08:34] that forward. And now I can slide that
[08:36] part forward. I'm just going to climb
[08:38] in. Shut that door behind me. Right. I'm
[08:41] going to move this one out of the way so
[08:43] you can see what's happening.
[08:46] Right. Yo. Oh.
[08:50] Right. Clearly doesn't have a memory on
[08:53] it. So, what you'd need is someone to
[08:55] get into the front. Jack, could you just
[08:57] jump into the front? I do find that
[08:58] these seats sit quite high the floor, so
[09:00] you do have decent under thigh support
[09:02] for being in the third row. So, Jack Oh,
[09:04] no, sorry. I know I said front. I meant
[09:07] in front of me.
[09:07] The middle.
[09:08] Yeah, we'll get there in the end. Right.
[09:11] Get in the middle. How tall are you?
[09:13] 62.
[09:13] 6'2. So, let's see if you can get comfy
[09:15] in front of me.
[09:20] You need to have an okay amount of knee
[09:22] room. Happy that you go, I don't know,
[09:24] 100 miles. Yeah, that's okay. I'm full
[09:27] upright at the moment.
[09:28] Go on then. Get a bit of recline on. Get
[09:29] yourself comfy.
[09:31] Look at that. I'm fine here. And there's
[09:34] a little cutout underneath this seat so
[09:36] I can slide my toes underneath it to get
[09:39] really comfy. It's very, very good. I've
[09:41] got two cup holders here. Decent size
[09:43] window. And look, we have air vents back
[09:45] here as well. The headroom is amazing,
[09:48] too. So roomy, so spacious. Really,
[09:50] really useful family car. Yes, Matt. Why
[09:53] are they holding the headliner up with
[09:54] buttons?
[09:55] These things here. So, here in the back
[09:56] and in the front there's these little
[09:58] things here and it says on it acoustic
[09:59] control. There's a little microphones in
[10:01] there and they use the noise
[10:03] cancellation system. So, as you're
[10:04] driving along it picks up like the
[10:05] noise, the ambient noise and then plays
[10:07] an opposite noise through the speakers
[10:09] to cancel it out. So, the car should be
[10:11] nice and quiet. You can get the Ionic 9
[10:13] with hands-free tailgate opening. So, as
[10:16] long as you have the key in your pocket,
[10:17] if you get close to the boot like that,
[10:19] wait for a minute or flash it indicators
[10:21] and then the boot will open. It's quite
[10:23] handy if you got hands full of shopping
[10:25] or luggage or whatever. Anyway, the boot
[10:27] capacity with all seven seats in place
[10:29] is 338
[10:31] L, which is about the same as an Hyundai
[10:34] i20 hatchback. It's not bad considering
[10:36] you can carry seven people with that
[10:37] much room. Let's see what it actually
[10:39] means in terms of what you can carry.
[10:43] because it's quite a square shape. I
[10:45] think that's going to be all right. Now,
[10:47] obviously with this third row in place,
[10:51] you don't have a load cover. So, four
[10:54] four easily fit. You could probably
[10:56] mount another two up there like that.
[10:58] But
[11:00] Oh, yeah. Look, you can That's good.
[11:04] Look.
[11:06] Oh. Oh, wait, wait, wait.
[11:11] Bear with me. Look, this has six seats.
[11:14] So, there's a suitcase for every seat.
[11:17] Brilliant.
[11:23] It will shut. Calling it now. Yes.
[11:26] Brilliant. Now, you might think that's
[11:28] impressive, but if you want an even more
[11:30] impressive boot capacity with all seats
[11:33] in place in a big sevenseater or
[11:34] six-seater MPV, you need to check out my
[11:36] video review of the VW ID Buzz. You can
[11:39] do that by clicking on the pop-up banner
[11:40] up there or scanning the QR code on
[11:42] screen. Now, there's also a link in the
[11:44] description of this video. I'm going to
[11:46] get these out. Bear with me.
[11:50] I mentioned the load cover. It's
[11:52] actually neatly stored under there, but
[11:53] you're only going to use that when you
[11:55] fold down these seats, which you can do
[11:57] dead easy by just pressing these
[11:59] buttons.
[12:03] And now you have over 900 L of luggage
[12:06] space. Look at that. Now, I could put
[12:07] all of these in there. I'm not going to
[12:09] bore you with it. Now, look, they'd
[12:10] easily fit in there, but I'm not going
[12:11] to do that. Instead, I'm going to fold
[12:12] down the middle row once again. Press a
[12:14] button.
[12:16] These just flip straight down like that.
[12:18] Yeah, there are gaps. Can you see? So,
[12:19] like things might get a little bit
[12:20] trapped, but it's not too much of a
[12:22] problem. Very, very practical car there.
[12:24] So, you got some other features in the
[12:25] boot such as 12 V socket there. You got
[12:27] some tie down points. You have that
[12:30] switch there which will hold this boot
[12:32] at a certain height. So, if you have to
[12:33] open it in like load garages, you can
[12:35] set the height lower. What's this?
[12:38] This is a release for something. What do
[12:40] you reckon that's for? Let me know in
[12:41] the comments. Anyway, let's just check
[12:43] out the front boot. See if it's got one.
[12:45] Most cars have like a cable pull to open
[12:47] the front boot, but this one, look, it's
[12:49] a button. It's electric. Double press
[12:50] it. There we go. It's open. Let's see
[12:52] what kind of space we got under here, if
[12:54] any at all.
[12:57] Look, there we go. There is some. It's
[12:59] always good to have a play separate than
[13:00] your boots to hold your charging cables.
[13:03] That's 52 L of space. If you go for the
[13:04] rear drive only version, this is the
[13:06] dual motor. You actually have 88 L of
[13:08] space. And that brings me on to five
[13:10] annoying things about the Ionic 9. This
[13:13] is a high-tech car, and you have thought
[13:15] that Highendai would have figured out
[13:16] the problem of warning pedestrians when
[13:18] it's reversing in a better way than they
[13:20] actually have. Put the car into drive
[13:23] and that is a noise you get when the
[13:24] car's moving forwards. It's not too
[13:26] loud. It's fine. But when you put it
[13:27] into reverse,
[13:30] it gets louder because it's only got one
[13:33] speaker and it's in the front. So if the
[13:35] car's reversing and the people behind
[13:36] it, they need to be able to hear it. So
[13:38] they just amp up the volume. Just fit
[13:40] another speaker at the back. Here's
[13:42] another thing where they could have just
[13:43] added a bit more tech, especially when
[13:45] you consider this particular car I've
[13:46] got here is £80,000. So the wireless
[13:48] charging pad there, it's great. It's got
[13:50] these grippers and it can charge
[13:52] reasonably quickly as well. Problem with
[13:53] that is that your phone does get hot and
[13:55] they haven't fitted any cooling like so
[13:58] many other manufacturers do. Why not?
[14:00] The optional digital door mirrors are
[14:03] 1,000 extra. Don't bother with them and
[14:05] I'll explain why now. You see, they may
[14:07] reduce the drag of the car by.1 CD, but
[14:10] that's not going to add that much range.
[14:12] And they're nowhere near as good as
[14:13] normal traditional door mirrors. First
[14:15] off, you don't really have any depth
[14:17] perception when you're using a camera
[14:19] compared to a normal mirror. Also, the
[14:22] way they work is that they have a
[14:23] zoomedin image. You don't actually move
[14:25] the camera around. And so, what it does
[14:28] is just move around that zoomed in image
[14:30] when you're pressing the button to
[14:32] actually look about and angle the
[14:34] mirror. It's a bit like a Ring doorbell.
[14:36] So, with a normal mirror, you'll be able
[14:37] to like angle it all the way out here,
[14:39] but I'm probably lost from that image
[14:40] now. And then there's the fact that when
[14:42] you're reversing next to a curb, with a
[14:43] normal mirror, you can angle them all
[14:45] the way down to clearly see your rear
[14:47] alloy wheel. So, you don't curb them.
[14:49] With this, it sort of zooms out to give
[14:51] you the full zoomed out image, but you
[14:53] can't really see
[14:55] the rear wheels. That's going to be no
[14:58] good for parking. Like I said, don't
[15:00] bother with them. This is one long car.
[15:02] It's over 5 m in length. As a result,
[15:05] the turning circle isn't great. It's
[15:07] 12.5 m, which is worse than these
[15:10] competitors. Now, in other markets, you
[15:12] can get rear axle steering, which will
[15:14] make the turning circle probably about 1
[15:16] m less. For some reason though, you
[15:18] can't get it in the United Kingdom.
[15:19] Thanks, High and Die. Oh, this is a
[15:21] practical family car. So, we got Ice Fix
[15:22] on the front passenger seat. Wait a
[15:25] minute.
[15:27] There's none. However, it's not all bad
[15:28] because you do have four other ISOIX
[15:32] locations in this car. So, let's try
[15:34] them out. And that brings to five good
[15:36] things about this car. So, this is the
[15:37] first. Look at this. So, we've got
[15:39] Isopix here on these middle seats. And
[15:42] if you have the middle bench, you have
[15:44] the same two in the middle row. As you
[15:47] can see, it's very easy to get a big
[15:48] rearfacing seat in to the car cuz you
[15:51] got big doors. But let's try in the back
[15:53] row. Can I get it in?
[15:56] It's not terrible. Actually, that wasn't
[15:58] too bad at all. Right. I fix easy to
[16:02] find. Really easy to find.
[16:05] This is about as easy as it gets. That's
[16:07] impressive. And if I give it a bit of
[16:09] that 360. Look at that. Look,
[16:17] that is doable.
[16:20] Impressive. You can use this car's
[16:22] battery to either power or charge lots
[16:25] of different things. For instance, you
[16:26] have a normal 3 pin socket here in the
[16:28] boot. So, a full 240 volt. So, my ammy
[16:32] in there, my Citroen Ammy. Look, it says
[16:33] it's charging. And it says it's charging
[16:35] over there. Yes, this little Citroen is
[16:38] like a poundite. this Hyundai just
[16:40] leeching its resources. That's not all
[16:42] though. These two USBC ports there can
[16:44] output up to 100 W, which is incredible.
[16:47] So, you can charge stuff like laptops.
[16:49] You hear that? It's charging. In fact,
[16:52] this computer's own wall charger only
[16:55] does 60 W. And then there's this. See
[16:58] this drawer here? You put your mobile
[17:01] phone in there, right? shut it and press
[17:05] this button here and it turns on UV
[17:07] lights in there which will disinfect
[17:09] your phone. The front seats have a
[17:11] special waiting to charge feature. If I
[17:14] press this button here,
[17:16] the steering wheel will move up out of
[17:18] the way. The seat will recline and this
[17:21] little pad will lift up to cushion your
[17:24] calves. I now feel like I'm about to
[17:26] undergo therapy. If someone or something
[17:28] blocks your view in the rear view
[17:30] mirror, don't worry. You can get this
[17:31] car with a special camera which looks
[17:34] out the back so you can still see in the
[17:36] mirror. Also, you can get the car with
[17:38] some blind spot cameras. So, when you
[17:40] indicate, it'll show you what's in your
[17:42] blind spot. Hello, it's actually me.
[17:44] Want an electric car that's good for
[17:45] towing? Well, look no further than the
[17:47] Ionic 9. It can tow 2.5 tons, which is
[17:50] as much as any EV can tow. The only
[17:53] other cars that can tow as much as this
[17:54] is the Kia EV9 and the BMW iX. The UK
[17:58] government has just announced £650
[18:00] million in grants to cut the cost of an
[18:02] electric car. As of now, manufacturers
[18:04] are busy applying for grants to get you
[18:06] up to 3,750 quid off an electric car.
[18:10] And the good news is this will also
[18:11] apply to leasing, which means you could
[18:13] save money on your monthly rentals. And
[18:15] if you're lucky enough to work for an
[18:17] employer that has an EV salary sacrifice
[18:19] scheme, the saving comes on top of any
[18:21] tax savings. So, it's a win-win. There's
[18:23] never been a better time to lease an
[18:25] electric car. Head to carow.co.uk/ley
[18:30] to browse leasing deals or check out our
[18:32] salary sacrifice scheme. All Highend
[18:34] Iionic 9ines come with a 106 kWh battery
[18:37] pack, but there are three motor options
[18:39] to choose from which affect your total
[18:41] range. The entry- level car with a
[18:42] single 218 horsepower motor has the
[18:44] longest range at 385 mi. Dual motor
[18:48] all-wheel drive cars with 307 horsepower
[18:50] can manage up to 376 mi. And this 427
[18:54] horsepower performance model can do 372
[18:58] mi. And later in this video, I'll find
[19:00] out how close this topsp spec Ioni 9 can
[19:02] actually get to this claimed range. So,
[19:04] which is my favorite version of the
[19:06] Highendai Ionic 9. So, I've actually
[19:08] configured it using the car
[19:09] configurator. If you want to find out
[19:11] what it is, click on the pop out banner
[19:12] up there or scan the QR code on screen
[19:14] now. There's also a link in the
[19:15] description of this video. You wouldn't
[19:18] expect a big, heavy electric SUV like
[19:20] this to feel sporty to drive. And you
[19:22] know what? This thing does not
[19:23] disappoint because it's not sporty to
[19:25] drive. However, if you think of it as
[19:27] being in a relationship, don't set your
[19:29] expectations too high and that way you
[19:32] won't be disappointed. And when you take
[19:33] this car for what it really is, a big
[19:35] heavy electric SUV, it actually corners
[19:37] well enough, it steers well enough, it's
[19:39] fine. And now I'm getting the lane
[19:42] keeping assist cutting in. So once
[19:43] again, instead of digging down into menu
[19:45] here, I can just press and hold the
[19:47] adaptive cruise control steering icon to
[19:50] turn that feature off as well.
[19:51] Brilliant. And now I can carry on
[19:54] talking to you about this car without
[19:55] being interrupted by drivers aids. Now I
[19:59] can get back to the expectations because
[20:01] you do expect a car like this to be a
[20:05] comfy cruiser and indeed it delivers in
[20:09] that respect. So the suspension is
[20:11] comfortable. Sometimes with electric
[20:12] cars they can be a bit jiggly over
[20:14] bumps. This one really isn't and it
[20:16] deals with bigger bumps extremely well.
[20:19] Now, it doesn't glide down the road in
[20:20] the same way that a BMW iX does on its
[20:22] air suspension, but like for like spec
[20:24] match one of these to an IX, and the EX
[20:26] is way more expensive. I tell you what
[20:28] does impress though, the noise levels.
[20:30] This car has that noise cancelling
[20:32] technology I've told you about. So, when
[20:33] you're cruising at speed, it's
[20:35] reasonably quiet. Also, you've got
[20:36] laminated glass to reduce wind noise.
[20:38] Plus, I actually found special
[20:40] insulation in the wings. I've never seen
[20:43] it on a car before. Maybe I just never
[20:44] noticed, but there's big panels in the
[20:46] wings, which are obviously there to soak
[20:48] up tire noise and wind noise, but it
[20:50] works. What I'm less impressed with,
[20:52] though, is the efficiency. So, this car
[20:54] is averaging 2.5 m per kowatt hour. When
[20:57] you multiply that up by the battery's
[20:59] capacity, you're looking at a real world
[21:00] range of around 270 mi. This particular
[21:03] version is supposed to do 370 mi. So,
[21:06] that's about 75% of what Highendai
[21:08] claims, which isn't brilliant. What is
[21:11] brilliant though is the control you have
[21:12] over the regen braking. So you can use
[21:14] these paddles. They're not for shifting
[21:16] gears cuz there are no gears, but you
[21:17] can alter the amount of regen. So you
[21:19] can actually turn it off so the car just
[21:21] coasts when you lift off the
[21:23] accelerator. Feels like it's just going
[21:24] to roll forever. Or you can just add in
[21:27] regen to four different levels. And the
[21:29] fourth level is I pedal. So I pedal
[21:32] means that you got full one pedal
[21:33] driving. So you can actually bring the
[21:35] car to complete standstill just by
[21:37] lifting off the accelerator. it'll give
[21:39] you that much regen braking. That gives
[21:40] you loads of control over driving the
[21:42] car at low speed, especially in town,
[21:44] and you don't actually have to touch the
[21:45] brake at all unless it's an emergency.
[21:47] Then there's the other thing you can do,
[21:48] which is go completely the other way and
[21:50] put it into auto mode. Now, what it does
[21:52] is use the standard fit adaptive cruise
[21:55] control technology to use the regen
[21:57] braking to keep your safe distance from
[21:58] the car in front. So, if I lift off the
[22:00] accelerator now, it notices I'm getting
[22:02] closer to the car in front. It's regen
[22:04] braking pretty strongly, but as that car
[22:06] starts to pull away, it's going to
[22:07] reduce the regen braking and let it
[22:08] coast more. All very, very clever. Not
[22:11] sure why it's not helping with the um
[22:12] efficiency, though. And you might be
[22:14] thinking, that's all on a good mat. But
[22:16] big car like this, it's going to be a
[22:17] bit cumbersome to navigate around a busy
[22:19] city or town street. But it's not as bad
[22:21] as you might think. Visibility is really
[22:23] good forward, at the sides, and even out
[22:26] the back. And of course, you got the
[22:27] backup of all the technology and the
[22:29] camera systems as well to help you out.
[22:30] You know what? Overall, I find this is a
[22:33] very, very pleasant, nice, relaxing car
[22:35] to drive, and I like it. It just allows
[22:37] you to get about fussfree. Now, let's
[22:39] check out the performance. So, I'm going
[22:41] to launch it from naugh to 60 and time
[22:44] it in three different modes. So, I'm
[22:45] going to start off in eco mode. See if
[22:47] it makes a difference what mode I'm in.
[22:49] So, we've got two electric motors cuz
[22:51] this is the range topping version.
[22:52] Four-wheel drive and a combined 427
[22:55] horsepower. Let's do it. Launching it. 3
[22:58] 2 1.
[23:02] [Music]
[23:03] That doesn't feel like 427 horsepower.
[23:07] 8.97 seconds to 60. Right, let's up the
[23:10] ante and go into normal mode. Should be
[23:12] faster this time. I hope it is.
[23:14] Otherwise, Oh, look. I've just noticed
[23:16] this. And you put the car into reverse.
[23:18] The lights here, the four little dots
[23:21] go red.
[23:23] So, 3 2 1.
[23:28] That's much stronger. Much stronger.
[23:32] 4.96 seconds. Mhm. That's quick for a
[23:36] big car. It's got really good traction
[23:38] and lots of performance. There is a bit
[23:40] of a delay when you first put your foot
[23:42] down. It doesn't feel like really
[23:43] snappy. It's a buildup of power. Let's
[23:45] try in sport. Ready? Here we go. 3 2 1
[23:52] pickup seems sharper.
[23:55] Have you got a quicker time though?
[23:57] Yeah, ever so slightly. Or is it the
[23:59] same? 4.93. Can't remember. It was so
[24:02] long ago. It's about the same. I think
[24:04] the pickup when you just floor it when
[24:06] you're moving seems sharper in sport
[24:08] mode than normal. So, it's a bit more
[24:09] aggressive. The throttle mapping. What
[24:11] was the thing I was going to do? I've
[24:13] forgotten that. This thing I thought I
[24:14] need to show you and I've just forgotten
[24:16] it.
[24:17] Why is it?
[24:22] Oh, well, if you pop into my head, I'll
[24:23] tell you.
[24:24] A few moments later.
[24:26] Oh, I know what I meant to tell you. So,
[24:27] we've got some other driving modes. I
[24:29] haven't tested them because they're
[24:30] actually for off-roading. Snow, mud, and
[24:32] sand. I'm not going to be taking this
[24:33] car in snow, mud, or sand, I don't
[24:35] think. Anyway, that was what I needed to
[24:37] tell you. I'm not going mud after all.
[24:39] Right. Breaking from 60 mph. Needs to be
[24:42] under 40 m. Really does on a dry day
[24:44] like today. If we can get close to 35,
[24:47] that would be good. Let's find out. It
[24:49] is heavy this thing, though. Here we go.
[24:50] Coming in hot right now.
[24:58] What we got? Wow, that's good. 34 m. I'm
[25:03] pleased with that. The car should be
[25:04] pleased with it. High and I should be
[25:05] pleased with it. You should be pleased
[25:06] with it. Everyone rejoice.
[25:11] [Music]
[25:14] So then, what's my final verdict on the
[25:16] new High and Die Ionic 9? Should you
[25:18] avoid it, consider it, short list it, or
[25:20] just go right ahead and buy it? Well, I
[25:22] reckon that if you're after a large,
[25:24] familyfriendly electric SUV, you should
[25:27] shortlist the Ionic
