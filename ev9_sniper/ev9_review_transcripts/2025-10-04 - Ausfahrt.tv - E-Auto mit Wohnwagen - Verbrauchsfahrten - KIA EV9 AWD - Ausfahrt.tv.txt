[00:00] Welcome to a new episode
[00:01] of Ausfahrt TV. Welcome to
[00:04] the
[00:05] electric car summer consumption drives. Consumption
[00:08] drives are actually a
[00:09] topic from asphaltart. At asphaltart
[00:12] you will find at least four
[00:14] consumption videos per month on a wide
[00:16] variety of vehicles. Take a look
[00:18] and see if the
[00:19] vehicle of your choice or your own
[00:21] vehicle is there. We determine the
[00:23] consumption of vehicles very professionally,
[00:26] regardless of whether they are electric, diesel or combustion engines.
[00:29] This video is a little different to what
[00:31] you are used to from Ausfahrt TV because
[00:33] it is always structured the same. I do
[00:34] n't assume that everyone watches all the videos.
[00:37] I suspect that one person
[00:39] finds one car interesting and
[00:41] another finds another. That is why there are
[00:42] elements in this video, such as this one
[00:44] and the greeting, which are always the same.
[00:46] However, I have given you jump marks so
[00:49] that you
[00:50] can simply skip the same sections. You see, yes,
[00:52] oops, I have seen that before. In the
[00:53] other video I simply skip
[00:55] the fifth video, which is completely different. For
[00:58] these electric car summer
[01:00] consumption drives we have
[01:02] taken four vehicles, four electric
[01:04] vehicles. These are the Tesla Model
[01:06] Y, the Kia i9 and the Smart. Hashtag 3 and the
[01:10] BMW i5 Touring and if you
[01:13] listen to them you'll notice that we're not interested in a
[01:14] comparison test it's not about
[01:17] which car is more economical than the other
[01:19] but rather we're interested in seeing how
[01:21] much electric cars consume when you have
[01:23] a caravan behind them but
[01:26] first of all we
[01:28] determined the standard consumption we drove the
[01:30] route that I'd like to introduce to you in a moment at
[01:31] 120 km/h
[01:35] then we drove the route with the
[01:37] caravan once at 80 and once
[01:39] at 100 to get a different
[01:41] feeling we drove with a
[01:43] bike rack attached to the back and
[01:46] two cars also had the roof box on
[01:48] top for the other
[01:49] two we didn't have a roof rack
[01:51] available child at this point a
[01:53] big thank you to Düsseldorf Z Partner
[01:56] leasingmarkt.de Germany's largest
[01:58] leasing portal and in my opinion
[02:01] one of the best you can
[02:03] check it out for yourself just click on the
[02:05] first link here under the video then
[02:07] you'll see the current leasing offers
[02:09] for our test car there
[02:12] you can set parameters do you want to make a down
[02:14] payment how long Do you want to
[02:16] lease? How many kilometers do you drive per
[02:17] year? Enter that in and then
[02:19] you can send it off and you will receive
[02:23] a personal,
[02:26] specific offer from the dealer who posted the leasing offer. This is free of charge and,
[02:28] above all, non-binding. In
[02:31] this video, I will show you how the
[02:33] Kia eV 9 performed.
[02:36] I have linked all the other videos below.
[02:38] As soon as they are online,
[02:40] you can click on the link and
[02:41] watch the other videos. I will go into the fifth video
[02:43] that we have posted online.
[02:46] I
[02:47] also drove the route with a VW Amarok 3 l TDI
[02:50] and with a Volvo XC90 T8.
[02:54] There we will put all the consumptions
[02:56] in relation together without
[02:58] aiming for a classic comparison.
[03:00] But first, the facts, facts, facts
[03:03] about today's towing vehicle. As part of the trailer
[03:06] consumption tests, we also
[03:08] drove this Kia i9 AWD. With a
[03:11] length of 5.2 and a wheelbase
[03:14] of 3.10 m, a height of 1.78 and a
[03:18] width of
[03:20] 2.26 including exterior mirrors, the
[03:23] SUV belongs to the segment. The upper class The
[03:25] base price of the Kia i9 is
[03:29] €72,409 The vehicle has two
[03:32] electric motors on each axle The
[03:34] electric motor on the front axle
[03:36] produces 141 kW or 192 hp
[03:40] and has a maximum torque of
[03:42] 350 newton meters The second electric motor
[03:45] on the rear axle has
[03:47] exactly the same data This results in
[03:50] a system output of 385 hp
[03:53] or
[03:54] 283 kW and a maximum
[03:57] system torque of 700 new meters Our
[04:01] test car accelerates from 0 to 100 in
[04:03] 5.3 seconds The top speed
[04:05] is 200 km/h The
[04:07] average consumption according to the manufacturer
[04:09] according to WLTP is 22.8 kowatt hours per
[04:13] 100 km Fully charged with 99.8 kW of
[04:18] electricity you can ideally travel
[04:21] 505 km according to WLTP With an unladen weight of
[04:25] 2,664 kg a maximum load of
[04:28] 576 kg The optional
[04:31] trailer hitch has a tongue load of
[04:34] 125 kg and can tow braked trailers with
[04:37] a Can pull a total weight of 2.5 tonnes.
[04:40] The electrical socket on the vehicle can be
[04:46] folded down from the vehicle floor. It sits very low but
[04:48] is still easy to reach. It's
[04:50] also nice that you can
[04:53] see the tow bar very clearly in the reversing camera, so you
[04:58] can drive as close as possible to the trailer mouth.
[05:01] I've also brought you my driving impression of the vehicle,
[05:02] but this
[05:03] really only relates to
[05:06] caravan operation. We've
[05:07] already presented the vehicle to you in
[05:09] a review, and the review is
[05:11] linked below. If you're
[05:12] generally interested in buying it after
[05:14] watching this trailer video,
[05:16] then take a quick look at the review.
[05:17] First of all, one thing that I did
[05:19] n't understand myself. I thought
[05:21] I would be able to maneuver a lot better with the big car
[05:23] because I could see more than
[05:25] with the small car. That was
[05:27] n't the case, though. I found it easier with the smaller
[05:30] vehicles than with
[05:32] the Kia. I'm not saying that it was the
[05:34] Kia's fault, though. The Kia offers two features that are
[05:41] cool for an electric car per se, but which are
[05:43] even more pleasant for me as a trailer driver.
[05:45] You drive. slowly to make progress
[05:48] and it's of course nice that
[05:50] they have an ergo motion seat with
[05:53] three programs pelvis lumbar whole
[05:55] body and then you can it's
[05:57] not a real massage but actually it is
[05:59] your back is definitely
[06:00] relieved and so you can
[06:03] drive longer distances more easily and
[06:04] keep going that's the first point the
[06:06] second point is
[06:08] also not unimportant you can convert this
[06:10] driver's seat the
[06:11] passenger seat too into a reclining seat
[06:13] not while driving of course
[06:15] but while charging and
[06:17] so you can take the 20 minutes that you
[06:20] need to get your colleague to 80%,
[06:22] just have a little power nap
[06:25] or even go up to 100% then it's more
[06:28] like 40 minutes and then you can
[06:33] take a bit longer, a power nap and I find that practical
[06:35] I'm a big fan of a lot of
[06:37] exercise during charging breaks but especially when
[06:40] you're driving longer distances with a
[06:41] trailer I actually find it
[06:44] nice if you can
[06:45] just close your eyes every now and then,
[06:47] listen to some music and
[06:49] do a little SP, a little SP, a
[06:51] little nap,
[06:53] otherwise the vehicle is of course
[06:56] beyond any doubt You don't even feel
[06:58] the trailer unless the
[06:59] road is so bad that you
[07:02] feel it through the drawbar,
[07:04] well, through the trailer hitch,
[07:05] shocks are then passed on,
[07:07] but that's the case with every car, purely in terms of
[07:10] power, you don't even notice the trailer,
[07:12] and I say that with every video
[07:14] here with the trailer videos, the
[07:16] electric cars, I find it almost a
[07:18] bit dangerous to tow an electric car
[07:20] trailer because the motor doesn't give any
[07:23] feedback at all, the
[07:24] engine noise, is it
[07:26] strained or not, and that
[07:28] goes away, sit, sit, you do
[07:30] n't even notice the speed, it's
[07:33] obviously very confident of the car,
[07:34] but sometimes it's not that
[07:37] easy, we usually
[07:39] drove with the cruise control anyway and
[07:41] it worked well and it
[07:44] helped me a lot, even when
[07:45] the lane departure warning system didn't
[07:49] work with the trailer, we
[07:52] drove the same route with all our cars, always the
[07:54] same, by the way, we also had the
[07:56] same weather conditions, it
[07:58] rained once but all the cars got the rain,
[08:00] the route is exactly
[08:02] 155 km. long and we start in Bielefeld
[08:06] Sennestadt at the Aral gas station why
[08:09] because it has both diesel and petrol
[08:11] as well as six fast chargers which
[08:14] can do 300 kW at least if you do
[08:16] n't have to share the column from the gas
[08:17] station we head south
[08:21] towards the
[08:23] A33 motorway after 1500 m there is a
[08:26] traffic light intersection there we turn right
[08:28] and then after another 300 m we turn
[08:31] left onto the
[08:32] A33 towards Padaborn
[08:35] we stay on the motorway for a good 27 km then turn off at
[08:38] the Padaborn Zentrum junction
[08:42] towards Salzkotten onto the
[08:44] B1 federal highway we stay there for a
[08:46] while we come to the roundabout turn
[08:48] right onto the A44 motorway
[08:52] towards Dortmund that is at km 44 at
[08:56] km 74 so 30 km later we
[09:00] then take exit 57 so it is east
[09:04] down and we keep right at the exit
[09:06] towards Sost yes
[09:09] we stay on the
[09:11] country road for a while exactly 25 km to then get back
[09:16] onto the A2 motorway towards Hanover
[09:19] and also towards Bielefeld of course
[09:21] and At kilometer marker 151, take
[09:25] exit 25 towards
[09:28] Bielefeld city center R. Then,
[09:31] directly after the traffic lights, we keep right at the exit and drive for
[09:34] another 4 km until
[09:36] we reach the gas station again. It
[09:39] is important at this point that
[09:41] we drive in a circle, so we compensate for
[09:43] any difference in altitude and that
[09:46] we always
[09:48] drive at the same speed. We had
[09:50] different speeds of
[09:55] 12080 and we always drove a maximum of 5
[09:58] km/h above the speedometer reading
[10:02] because it showed that this was one
[10:04] to 2 km/h above the respective
[10:07] speed according to GPS. This is of
[10:10] course not a clinical test.
[10:12] We always had cars on the road,
[10:14] trucks, some of which we had to overtake,
[10:16] some where we couldn't,
[10:19] some where we could hang in their slipstream, but sometimes not.
[10:21] So I think the result is
[10:24] still very close to reality.
[10:27] However, it is not a clinical laboratory
[10:29] result and is subject to
[10:32] slight distortion. I would
[10:34] also like to say that we always
[10:36] drove the cars at around 20°C, which is
[10:40] optimal temperature for an
[10:42] electric vehicle. Please don't come
[10:43] and say Man, I set off today in winter
[10:45] with my caravan. That's
[10:47] not possible. I only get halfway
[10:49] there. That's not the point. At the
[10:52] end of every journey, we
[10:53] got the electric car back up to 80%. We
[10:56] also set off with 80% for our
[11:00] figures, which I am now going to
[11:02] read out to you and recite. Please be careful.
[11:05] I always used 70% of the
[11:08] battery capacity because I
[11:10] assume that when I drive on the motorway,
[11:12] especially with a trailer, I will not charge any
[11:14] further than 80% because then the
[11:17] charging curve usually drops and charging takes an
[11:19] extremely long time. But I would
[11:21] n't drive much below 10% with the trailer
[11:24] because if the charging
[11:26] station doesn't work,
[11:28] you want to have a bit of reserve to
[11:30] at least get you a few more kilometers,
[11:31] especially with the
[11:33] consumption of the Kia EV9. It has a
[11:36] battery capacity of 99.8 kW/hours,
[11:39] 70% of which is 70 kW/hours. It has a
[11:43] WLTP consumption of 22.8 kW/hours per
[11:46] 100 km, and if I Taking the 70
[11:50] kWh as the capacity,
[11:53] I have a range of 307
[11:56] km. That's a bit of a
[11:57] naive calculation, because I
[12:00] always brake, so when I brake I recuperate, I
[12:02] gain braking energy and store it
[12:04] back in the battery, and can therefore drive
[12:06] a bit further. But this
[12:08] naive calculation is exactly right
[12:10] here for our
[12:13] consumption overview. We did one lap at 120 km/h,
[12:16] so it always says
[12:18] 120 km/h where it was possible, and 120 km/h where it wasn't possible, as fast
[12:20] as we were allowed to drive.
[12:23] According to the on-board computer, we needed 95 minutes for 202 km/h,
[12:28] that's an
[12:30] average speed of 96
[12:32] km/h, and the consumption according to the on-board computer
[12:36] was
[12:37] 24 kWh per 100 km, which is just an
[12:40] increase of
[12:43] 5.3% compared to the VLTP, and the
[12:46] range only shrinks
[12:48] slightly to
[12:50] 291.7 km.
[12:53] Then we
[12:55] attached the bike rack and drove at 120 km/h again, so
[12:59] ideally it took 99
[13:01] minutes, it
[13:04] always varies depending on traffic. 152 km/h According to the
[13:07] onboard computer it stayed the same, which is
[13:09] an average speed of 92
[13:11] km/h, which might also explain why the
[13:14] increased consumption isn't actually
[13:16] that high. It was 24 kw on the
[13:19] solo trip, 24.6 with the bike rack,
[13:22] which is an increase of just
[13:25] 2.5%, so it could mean that you can always
[13:28] drive with the bike rack, which increases the
[13:29] range to
[13:32] 284.6 km. Bike rack off, roof box
[13:35] on the roof, and off we went again. Target speed:
[13:39] 120. It took us 100 minutes.
[13:42] It stayed the same at 152 km, the average speed was 91 km/h. The
[13:46] consumption
[13:47] with the roof box was lower than with the
[13:49] bike rack, namely
[13:52] 24.4, which is only an increase of
[13:56] 1.7% compared to the solo trip, and
[13:59] so we covered
[14:01] 286.9 km. The roof rack and roof box were
[14:05] removed and the trailer was attached to the back.
[14:08] Target speed was 80. We needed 122 minutes
[14:12] for the 152 km, an
[14:14] average speed of 75 km/h.
[14:18] The onboard computer has a consumption of
[14:21] 34.7 kw per 100. km spent, that's
[14:25] an increase
[14:27] of
[14:28] 44.6 per lap and
[14:31] then results in a range with 70
[14:34] kilowatt hours of
[14:36] 201.7 km, the trailer stayed attached, we
[14:39] fully charged it to 80% and
[14:42] set off again this time at 100 km/h,
[14:44] only needed 18 minutes for
[14:47] the 152 km journey, which gives an
[14:50] average speed of 84 km/h,
[14:53] consumption was 42.6 kilowatt hours per
[14:56] 100 km, that's 77.5% more than on the
[15:02] solo lap and the range shrinks
[15:04] to
[15:06] 13, no,
[15:09] 164.3 km, now you might be expecting
[15:12] some kind of big conclusion from me but
[15:14] that wasn't what I was talking about, I
[15:15] just wanted to
[15:18] calculate these consumptions and show you how to compare them
[15:21] so that you
[15:22] out there can get an idea of ​​how far I can
[15:24] roughly get with an electric car, four
[15:27] vehicles, we have electric vehicles,
[15:30] you can watch these four videos,
[15:32] including the values, there is a
[15:34] fifth video where I put all the
[15:36] values ​​together in relation
[15:38] and tell you One more thing
[15:40] that's important: no matter
[15:43] which electric car you buy, if
[15:46] you want to drive long distances with a trailer,
[15:48] please just start, take
[15:51] a day or two and
[15:53] try to determine your vehicle's sweet spot.
[15:58] We didn't have enough time for that, but is
[16:00] it more sensible to drive at 86 or 96?
[16:05] You can get a bit
[16:07] closer that way, and if you have the sweet spot,
[16:09] you'll generally get
[16:11] a lot further in a relaxed manner. I can only
[16:13] tell you that for the trailer consumption trips,
[16:15] I picked up the trailer behind
[16:17] Munich, near Passau,
[16:19] with the BMW i5 and actually wanted to
[16:22] determine the sweet spot, but that was
[16:24] all far too boring for me.
[16:25] At some point, I only drove 100 because I was allowed to. I
[16:30] charged it 100,000 times. The charging worked quite well, by the way.
[16:32] I didn't even have to
[16:33] uncouple and was eventually
[16:37] home. On the way back, I
[16:39] drove with Jens, Jens
[16:40] Strahmann, and we had the Kia EV9. It
[16:44] wasn't necessarily that its
[16:46] performance was better. The battery
[16:47] is just a bit bigger, but we
[16:49] clearly Better planned, Jens
[16:52] set the speed and
[16:54] then checked the consumption again
[16:56] in between, and so
[16:58] I think we made it through with a total of three
[17:00] charging stops and we reached our
[17:03] destination one to two hours faster, which
[17:06] is clever, so
[17:09] you should always keep in mind, it's not about
[17:13] comparing the vehicles here, you have to have your
[17:14] own vehicle with its trailer, you wo
[17:17] n't all be buying the yaso,
[17:20] you just have to try things out and get closer,
[17:21] and then you have a
[17:23] reasonable value that you can work with
[17:25] and calculate, if I
[17:27] drive from here to Rimini, how long will it
[17:29] really take and which
[17:31] charging stations do I want to go to,
[17:34] of course I would also like to introduce you to the
[17:35] caravan that we tested,
[17:37] that's the Knaus yasio 340 PX,
[17:41] even though I do
[17:43] n't know anything about caravans, there is of course also a little room tour for
[17:45] this colleague of the Knausia COO 340 PX,
[17:49] what I
[17:52] find really practical is this
[17:53] coupling, you click it forward, then
[17:56] you lower the trailer onto the coupling,
[17:58] then it clicks in,
[18:01] and then you have For even more safety,
[18:04] we have a brake that
[18:05] works well, a trolley that you
[18:07] can lower properly and 13-
[18:10] pole power. Here at the front there are
[18:12] two handles that really
[18:14] helped me when maneuvering, for example into the
[18:16] workshop. Then you can
[18:19] open it up and you already have
[18:21] the first storage space, for example for
[18:24] the brake chocks. The charging cable
[18:27] and a second calibrated barrel go into this, as well as the
[18:30] crank for the rear supports. And
[18:33] underneath here is the
[18:35] toggle to lock or unlock the whole thing.
[18:37] At this point I can
[18:39] say that everything can be opened with the
[18:41] same key. Yes, back to the
[18:43] side, there is the
[18:45] water lock, then there is a
[18:47] smaller storage flap that I unlock,
[18:50] then comes the toggle and then I
[18:55] turn the toggle and then I can look inside here and there is
[18:57] also a box. There is
[19:00] also a large door, I
[19:01] asked myself, what do you want, children?
[19:03] You can open and
[19:05] close that too, and you can use it to get into the
[19:07] interior. It's intended as a
[19:10] bicycle garage. For example, you
[19:12] can simply drive in here
[19:15] and out at the back.
[19:17] Because there's the second door at the
[19:19] back, there's nothing much to see
[19:21] except that we have two more
[19:23] handles here. I also used these for
[19:24] maneuvering and darkened LED
[19:28] taillights. On the left side, we have
[19:30] the storage hatch here, the
[19:32] loading hatch, then in front of the axle, the
[19:35] option to
[19:37] connect shore power and behind this hatch is
[19:39] the
[19:42] toilet housing, basically the
[19:44] fecal tank, which you can also replace.
[19:46] I've already shown you the second one.
[19:48] Once the door is opened,
[19:52] it clicks into place at the back
[19:54] if you want. There's a small magnetic bag hanging on the door,
[19:59] which I think is very clever, either as a
[20:01] small shopping bag or as a
[20:03] rubbish bag or or or here's the
[20:06] door lock and there are
[20:09] two coat hooks up top. By the way,
[20:12] I have
[20:13] blackout blinds everywhere and on the top
[20:16] side, when you open the window, there's
[20:17] also mosquito net. It kicks in here,
[20:20] but it's also really necessary, which I've
[20:21] just shown you, because you have to go pretty
[20:25] high. I've just
[20:27] come in here, there's a
[20:30] switch battery, so I can
[20:31] see how my
[20:33] battery is behaving, the water and also
[20:37] the brackish water, that's my first impression of
[20:40] the cabin, we have an ambient
[20:42] light here and there, down here
[20:45] I also have a
[20:46] light switch, I can turn it on and
[20:49] off, but I can also switch a bit
[20:53] more on and off, then there's
[20:55] a
[20:56] roof hatch here, which I can of course open,
[20:58] there was the blackout blind, and
[21:00] shown here is the
[21:02] mosquito protection, and I can
[21:05] set it up completely here as usual, I'll go
[21:08] back, then you'll have a
[21:11] seating area here, that's understandable,
[21:14] I think, and there's a table for the seating area, which
[21:17] I'll hang up here and there. Now there is another
[21:22] button here that I press so that I
[21:24] can unlock the leg and whoosh, whoosh,
[21:27] you can work really well here too.
[21:30] If I press the yellow button here,
[21:32] and first I have put away the
[21:34] two pillows,
[21:41] then I fold
[21:44] out the entire bed and it is nice and
[21:46] big, I find that very sexy and you can
[21:49] see that you are wasting quite
[21:51] a bit of space in the caravan.
[21:53] However, there are of course
[21:54] storage compartments up there too, you have
[21:56] storage compartments, there is another storage compartment,
[21:58] so there is really plenty of space here
[22:00] and also these two
[22:02] swan-heated reading lights that I can
[22:05] find here again, they can have
[22:06] normal brightness and then
[22:09] they can also be blue, which I find
[22:11] quite practical HS, and
[22:15] so you can sleep comfortably here,
[22:17] of course you always have to clear the table
[22:19] accordingly. Next to the
[22:20] bed there is another light switch for
[22:23] the ambient light, but also a
[22:25] control, I think for the air conditioning,
[22:28] only I don't think it is mounted
[22:29] here in our car. On the other side
[22:31] we have another cupboard with
[22:33] a wardrobe rail where I
[22:35] can hang up shirts etc. and
[22:38] there are also
[22:40] air vents on both sides.
[22:42] We can of course also have
[22:44] a look inside the side of the wall cupboard. This is what it looks like on
[22:47] one side. And on the other side,
[22:50] I have these narrower things
[22:52] here. By the way, there is also a
[22:54] preparation for a satellite TV. The
[22:57] windows have three toggles, one here on
[22:59] the sides. These two and this one you have to
[23:01] press the button first and then
[23:03] I can turn them off and they
[23:05] lock themselves. And here is the
[23:07] mosquito net from above. And oh,
[23:11] it's different here. Both are from above.
[23:13] And the blackout blinds are here too. There are
[23:15] even small
[23:17] curtains here if you want. Now
[23:19] I'm standing with my back to the wall and here
[23:21] we can see the kitchen unit.
[23:24] The black one is the fridge. It has
[23:26] a small ice compartment and quite a bit of storage
[23:29] space. The yaso is also
[23:31] an electric hob. What's that
[23:34] called? An inductive hob.
[23:36] And a water tap with a small
[23:38] sink. And here's even a
[23:40] water dispenser. I think that's
[23:42] good for cooking. There's a small window in front of it.
[23:45] The cupboard has an
[23:48] opening mechanism. That's a
[23:50] socket. I find that practical too.
[23:51] Small sockets in the
[23:53] cupboards. It's really
[23:56] practical, just like this little
[23:58] shelf here by the door, which can of course be
[24:00] used as a spice rack. Then
[24:03] I turn here to open the cupboard. There
[24:05] I have
[24:08] the heating and a fuse and
[24:11] another large wardrobe and
[24:13] underneath there are
[24:15] two
[24:16] drawers that work the same way. You
[24:19] push it in to secure it or out. No, not
[24:21] at all. The bottom one isn't a
[24:22] drawer, but I have the
[24:24] battery for the caravan. Here I
[24:27] also have three more drawers in the
[24:29] kitchen unit, one with
[24:32] cutlery and
[24:35] then down here there's another
[24:37] utility compartment. The only thing we're
[24:40] really missing now is this
[24:42] door. Then there's the toilet,
[24:47] nice with all kinds of mirrors. That
[24:50] of course makes the room a lot bigger. There
[24:53] 's the toilet, which you then basically
[24:56] empty into the tank below. At the same
[24:59] time you can see there's
[25:00] a shower tray down there, which means what
[25:03] a lovely sink.
[25:06] You can pull the colleague
[25:09] out here and then have a shower
[25:11] if you want. There's also a
[25:14] bit of storage space here,
[25:17] so that you can get to
[25:20] important things like the
[25:23] water supply if necessary. The
[25:26] flushing takes place down there and we also have
[25:29] Storage compartment and of course the whole thing has its
[25:31] own lighting here,
[25:34] by the way there's also a roof hatch which
[25:37] I can also protect with the mosquito
[25:39] net, yes and the whole thing once
[25:42] driven down here, oh we have one more lap back
[25:45] up, yes
[25:47] I just left out the shelf here,
[25:49] of course it's practical for any
[25:50] books, there's a
[25:52] ventilation grille at the back and where does the air have to go
[25:54] and here we also have a
[25:57] shower curtain
[25:59] so that you don't get everything dirty and up here
[26:01] I have the option of
[26:02] hanging the shower head and
[26:05] you can open the mirror too, there's also
[26:06] a small shelf, very
[26:08] basically again the Knaus
[26:10] yaso 340 PX is a caravan for
[26:16] electric operation, someone wrote me a
[26:17] comment which said yes, but
[26:19] you have to be careful, not every
[26:21] campsite wants that because if everyone
[26:25] heats with electric heat then a
[26:27] lot of electricity is taken from the grid, the
[26:29] campsites are not covered by the GEZ, but if
[26:31] you can take the electricity from the car,
[26:33] for example, if you have a vehicle that
[26:35] can load vehicles such as a Kia ev9
[26:39] or eV 6 or the Hyundai vehicles,
[26:41] then you can basically use the electricity from your
[26:43] vehicle then
[26:45] nobody should complain however you do have to be
[26:46] able to park your car next to the
[26:48] caravan as a big
[26:51] battery and so everything here is really
[26:54] electrically solved there is also the
[26:58] option to
[26:59] add additional gas you can see when you configure the caravan but that doesn't
[27:01] really make any sense because
[27:03] you do without the gas bottle to
[27:05] save weight and to leave the whole line out
[27:07] here too you want to
[27:09] operate it as an electric caravan
[27:12] otherwise you can just
[27:12] get a conventional caravan anyway I
[27:15] think it's good that the gas option is still there
[27:16] so you know at least if you're
[27:19] not so
[27:21] keen on electromobility anymore then you could still
[27:23] switch or if you
[27:24] want to park one somewhere stationary then
[27:26] you could retrofit gas
[27:28] or buy it retrofitted or already pre-equipped
[27:31] I've given you a link to the
[27:33] jaso below in the
[27:35] item description I'm
[27:37] not advertising the Knaus caravan
[27:39] I only asked about it because I
[27:40] thought it would be so nice to have an electric caravan
[27:43] to determine the consumption of
[27:45] electric cars I
[27:47] got the caravan normally as part of
[27:49] a press Test setup normally
[27:51] you spend the night in here and see
[27:53] how it works
[27:55] but I have no idea about that I don't have a
[27:56] lot of expertise in the fuel cell and that's why we
[27:59] only used it for the
[28:00] consumption runs and I can't give you
[28:02] any experience report I
[28:03] hope you now have a good
[28:05] idea of ​​what it really consumes at
[28:08] 120 normal driving anyone can
[28:11] determine that but also with a trailer
[28:13] or with a
[28:14] bike rack or even with a roof box
[28:17] yes did you find that exciting do you drive
[28:20] an electric car yourself and use the
[28:22] trailer then please let us
[28:24] know in the comments what you
[28:26] think and if you say yes but your
[28:28] diesel or petrol car is much
[28:30] better then watch our fifth
[28:32] video there we are happy to discuss with
[28:35] you what really makes sense if
[28:37] you want to go on holiday with a caravan
[28:38] I'll say goodbye
[28:40] at this point I would be delighted if you gave me
[28:42] a thumbs up that was
[28:43] pretty complex what you did and I would be
[28:46] very pleased if you
[28:47] commented actively please subscribe to
[28:49] ausfahr TV and above all if
[28:51] you are interested in consumption also the type of
[28:53] asphalt I I'll say goodbye at
[28:55] this point as always and say bye see you
[28:57] later EU yes yes and just a quick
[28:59] reminder all the other videos are
[29:02] linked down here on good you can
[29:04] watch everything if you want plus
[29:06] the fifth video and I personally find that
[29:08] very exciting because I hope
[29:09] that we can really get into dialogue
[29:11] with each other
