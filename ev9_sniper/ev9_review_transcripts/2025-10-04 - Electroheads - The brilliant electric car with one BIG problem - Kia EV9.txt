[00:00] this is
[00:03] absolutely
[00:05] humongous hello Electro heads I in the
[00:08] land of the free the home of the brave
[00:10] and the big talking about cars I mean
[00:13] now I am used to being in my own bubble
[00:15] in London when I see a 4x4 Land Rover
[00:18] bomin it around the city and I'm just
[00:19] thinking how unnecessary it is for it to
[00:21] be there and then you come to America I
[00:23] mean I'm in Los Angeles this week and
[00:25] you realize just how humongous the cars
[00:28] are here it truly is a world of
[00:30] the super size but I do actually have
[00:32] quite a big car with me today but one I
[00:34] can be slightly more forgiving to
[00:36] because it is a large SUV but it's built
[00:38] for purpose and in fact it's one of the
[00:40] first EVS made as a purpose-built 6 and
[00:43] seven seater deated to bigger families
[00:45] and for those who require a lot of cargo
[00:47] space a whopping
[00:49] 2,232 l in fact with all the passenger
[00:51] seats folded down or 828 L with the
[00:54] third row seats folded there are two
[00:56] seating configurations available you
[00:58] need to go for the top spec GT lines to
[01:00] get a six seater which is the one that I
[01:02] have today otherwise the seven seater is
[01:04] available as standard to all three trims
[01:06] with a max range claim of 349
[01:09] miles this is so big now granted I am
[01:12] driving this solo today which I
[01:14] appreciate makes me a total hypocrite
[01:18] however there is a theme Here
[01:19] particularly in America where bigger is
[01:22] better and I do think that we are
[01:23] adopting that more and more in the UK
[01:25] and I would like to argue that maybe
[01:27] that shouldn't always be the case
[01:28] firstly the size of Road so when the
[01:31] motor car was first introduced in the UK
[01:34] which was just before the 1900s those
[01:36] cars were pretty ply compared to what we
[01:38] have today now cars are of course
[01:40] growing in size but the roads very
[01:43] difficult to make them grow and there's
[01:44] obviously a lot of issues that come with
[01:45] that also it's not particularly
[01:48] pedestrian friendly in America compared
[01:51] to well I mean the UK there is so much
[01:55] expanse in the US you can walk a mile
[01:57] and really not get that far but now
[01:59] granted there are pedestrianized areas
[02:01] in America I am being very generous here
[02:03] and if you do live in one of those areas
[02:05] then give it a shout out drop me a
[02:07] comment down below and let me know where
[02:09] you are cuz I'd love to hear from you
[02:11] but secondly it's all about safety now
[02:14] the thing is as cars have gotten bigger
[02:16] they've gotten heavier they've also
[02:17] gotten more dangerous so say if somebody
[02:21] was to unfortunately go into me then
[02:24] yeah of course I would want to have a
[02:26] vehicle that felt able to basically
[02:28] protect me if such an thing were to
[02:31] happen now the Kia ev9 has gotten a
[02:34] really good end cap rating The toppest
[02:36] rating it can get of five stars and that
[02:38] is really encouraging for owners and
[02:41] families who want to use a car like this
[02:44] but we mustn't also forget about other
[02:46] more vulnerable Road users like cyclists
[02:49] and pedestrians because if you get hit
[02:52] by one of these you're not making out
[02:54] [Music]
[02:57] live as you can see here I'm driving on
[03:00] the LA freeway which you do a speed of
[03:03] 65 mph there's multiple Lanes to make
[03:06] sure that all the traffic all the
[03:08] vehicles have ample space to get through
[03:11] and get to the destination because this
[03:12] is a big place and uh people want to get
[03:15] there as easily and most conveniently as
[03:18] possible but one thing I have noticed
[03:20] it's also the speeds that people go at
[03:23] in the more kind of suburban areas now
[03:26] down in LA in the kind of City bit where
[03:28] there are pedestrians spe limit is a
[03:30] little bit more like 35 mph now me
[03:33] coming from London I'm quite used to
[03:34] like 20 mph roads and that in itself has
[03:38] been implemented because 20 mph can also
[03:41] do a good bit of damage if you hit a
[03:43] pedestrian at that top speed so 35 mph
[03:47] driving in these
[03:49] behemoths I mean this alone is it's over
[03:53] 2,500 kilg in weight so just the idea
[03:56] that you're driving at 35 mph around
[03:59] pedestrians is just a little bit
[04:01] frightening for me I have to say man but
[04:03] I can't deny this car feels so nice to
[04:07] drive honestly I'm just really
[04:09] conflicted by this car and you think as
[04:11] well with roads being much larger that
[04:13] there would be less traffic but actually
[04:15] quite the opposite happens particularly
[04:17] here in Los Angeles which is known for
[04:21] its terrible terrible traffic jams
[04:23] there's actually a really great book
[04:24] that I love is called happy City and it
[04:26] goes way deeper into basically the
[04:29] effect of urban sprawl which is
[04:31] something that we see a lot here in
[04:33] America something that hasn't happened
[04:35] so much in the UK because there isn't as
[04:37] much land mass but it really does have
[04:40] such an effect on people because if
[04:42] you're driving more if you're spending
[04:44] more time in your car which people are
[04:46] these days because they're living
[04:47] further out it just means that there is
[04:49] actually a lot more underlying stress
[04:51] that is going through and around your
[04:53] body look at this road though I mean I
[04:55] can't lie this is really beautiful and
[04:58] definitely not stressful sorry I'm
[05:01] trying to be serious here with um some
[05:03] serious issues to talk about but oh God
[05:05] this car's really fun it's really
[05:10] fun my God okay did the police just put
[05:14] their sirens on that guy near skined
[05:15] into me that was mental did you see that
[05:18] well I'm glad the police were right
[05:19] there maybe the police were chasing him
[05:21] must have been all right well that's a
[05:25] bit of action isn't it but actually it
[05:27] has to be said with Los Angeles when you
[05:28] see the road quality like generally
[05:31] there are some really bad bits like when
[05:32] I've been here before where I can almost
[05:34] empathize with why people have these
[05:37] kind of monster truck style vehicles
[05:39] with this insane suspension cuz you kind
[05:42] of need it so you don't get your vehicle
[05:43] scratched up parking these Giants is
[05:45] also another thing now it's obviously
[05:47] fine if you're somebody who lives in the
[05:49] countryside and has a really big
[05:51] driveway however if you're like me and
[05:53] you live in London or parking one of
[05:55] these baddies is well it's a bit of a
[05:58] nightmare really because you'll be
[05:59] looking around for an available lamp
[06:01] poost so you can do your public charging
[06:03] and uh you'll just pray to God if it's
[06:05] available that the parking space is
[06:07] actually big enough and then you got to
[06:08] do a parallel park with that thing you
[06:10] can even get smart parking for most new
[06:13] electric cars these days I mean Kia do
[06:14] it as well which basically means that it
[06:17] takes the egg out of parking these huge
[06:19] Vehicles even if they do have that 360
[06:22] coverage or the kind of the rear cameras
[06:24] front cameras they are just well they're
[06:28] just very big to par I mean it's okay
[06:31] cuz I'm on this huge Street here in Los
[06:33] Angeles it's kind of built for that but
[06:35] l so in the UK however I can't help but
[06:38] be impressed by the EV 9's capabilities
[06:42] when it comes to how spacious and
[06:45] comfortable it is in here particularly
[06:48] as a six seater I mean this could almost
[06:50] be a living room and uh compared to
[06:53] London prices I think this probably
[06:55] costs about the same as the price of a
[06:57] London living room in the six seater
[06:59] everybody gets ample room there's charge
[07:01] ports for each passenger the ev9 also
[07:04] has vehicle to load which basically
[07:06] means that you can use this car as a
[07:08] moving battery pack say if you want to
[07:09] go camping and you want some extra
[07:11] Comfort or there is a plug in the back
[07:14] here that you can use to plug your
[07:16] laptop straight into the car so if
[07:18] you're charging up you can get some work
[07:20] done the center console also doubles up
[07:23] as extra storage and usage for your
[07:25] second row passengers you get a nice
[07:27] tray that pulls out here which you can
[07:28] use to put some food on
[07:30] with extra storage space these
[07:32] particular ones don't do it however a
[07:34] 180 swivel seat option is also available
[07:36] so these second row seats can completely
[07:39] turn around plus there's a lot of
[07:40] eco-friendly materials that been used
[07:42] here and Kia love to shout about it
[07:43] there's even a relaxation mode for the
[07:45] two front seats here so when you're
[07:47] charging you can recline and scroll but
[07:49] this is the thing because we have
[07:50] increased car usage which means even
[07:53] more traffic jams our cars have become a
[07:55] second home now more than ever now on
[07:57] the topic of traffic because it's quite
[07:59] a prent one here in Los Angeles I mean
[08:02] even when we landed at LAX airport it
[08:04] took us 40 minutes and I'm not even
[08:06] joking you to get out from the fourth
[08:09] level of the car park down to the exit
[08:13] 40 minutes we were just sat in the car
[08:15] crawling just waiting to get out and
[08:17] then that was just such a stark reminder
[08:19] of what was to come in a place like this
[08:21] you do end up just spending a lot of
[08:23] time sitting in your car whether it's
[08:26] being in traffic or needing to go
[08:28] somewhere because this is a really big
[08:30] place and actually I have seen footage
[08:32] of when there's been a school run in
[08:34] America and there has been genuinely
[08:37] miles of cars in traffic just waiting to
[08:40] pick up their kid and you see comments
[08:42] underneath like I've seen this on
[08:43] Instagram before and there are comments
[08:45] like oh why don't the kids just walk
[08:46] home why don't they because there aren't
[08:49] any Pavements like there are literally
[08:51] not any Pavements for the kids to be
[08:53] able to walk home so people have to come
[08:55] and pick up their kids I mean it's a
[08:56] whole different mentality here and it
[08:58] just means that we are spending more and
[09:00] more time in our cars because of these
[09:02] choices of how the city's been built and
[09:05] in fact it's something just really
[09:06] important to talk about I truly do feel
[09:09] conflicted about a vehicle like this
[09:10] because I think it looks really good
[09:13] even though it is a block of a car I
[09:15] think it really is fun to drive I can't
[09:18] deny that and it offers so much in terms
[09:21] of what a driver and its passengers
[09:23] would want in a car and particularly
[09:25] with that cargo space it can store so
[09:27] much in there as well but it is just
[09:30] humongous vehicle isn't it and we can't
[09:32] forget that I mean these cars are just
[09:34] becoming more and more oversized but it
[09:37] does have reason for it because we do
[09:39] need seven seaters and it is broadening
[09:40] the market of electric vehicles because
[09:42] we are still quite constricted with what
[09:44] is available although it is quite a
[09:45] pricey option so as you can see
[09:49] conflicted but I've had a really great
[09:50] day and there are some seriously loud
[09:53] motorbikes coming up here let's just
[09:55] wait for those to finish
[10:01] anyway I know this is a little bit of a
[10:03] different video compared to normal it's
[10:04] not quite a car review in a sense but I
[10:06] thought it was definitely a topic that
[10:08] needs to be discussed because I'm here
[10:09] in America it's my first time driving
[10:11] this humongous vehicle and yeah there
[10:13] are conflicted feelings around it but
[10:15] what do you guys think at home let me
[10:16] know down in the comments make sure you
