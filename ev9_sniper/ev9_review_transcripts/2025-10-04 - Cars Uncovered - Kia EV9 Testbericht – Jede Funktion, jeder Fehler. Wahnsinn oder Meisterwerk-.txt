[00:00] I'll start with the fact then. Did you
[00:01] know that there are only nine electric
[00:04] cars in the world that can sit seven
[00:07] people? And although this starts at
[00:09] £65,000, I would argue it offers more,
[00:12] is more original, and well, look at it.
[00:15] It's it's a fortress. And there are so
[00:18] many exciting quirks in this car that it
[00:21] will make you think, hang on, wait, how
[00:24] why is it only Kia that's offering all
[00:26] of this stuff? It this is the most
[00:28] unique experience ever. I mean, you
[00:30] know, we've done loads of electric cars,
[00:31] but this is unlike it's not even a car.
[00:34] It's a thing. It's a thing. This is
[00:40] Yeah. And you could say that this is a
[00:42] new generation. I mean, look at this.
[00:44] 82% and 269 mi means in realworld Howard
[00:49] terms, that's 328
[00:51] miles. And look at this. Your energy
[00:53] consumption history, which is very
[00:54] useful to see who was driving. Looks
[00:57] like my mom was driving that day, but it
[00:58] actually wasn't. It was me. 4.2 m per
[01:01] kilowatt hour. I've not seen numbers
[01:02] like that. Have you? Kia say you'll be
[01:04] able to get 154 mi in 15 minutes or 20
[01:09] to 80% in 24 minutes, which is just
[01:12] enough time for you to go into the
[01:13] services, have a we and overpay for a
[01:15] coffee, which I did earlier just for
[01:18] you. I like that. What is it? Don't ask
[01:21] me what it is. I just like it. This is
[01:22] the much talked about Kia new front
[01:24] light design signature which is
[01:26] beautiful across most of the range. Very
[01:28] nice. And have a look at these. They
[01:30] really catch my eye especially at night.
[01:32] I've also noticed down here we have
[01:35] these flaps which open, sometimes they
[01:37] close, sometimes they open depending on
[01:39] whether the car needs cooling. But we
[01:40] know what they're really for, don't we?
[01:42] Exactly. Your guns. And have a look at
[01:44] this. The number plate EV9. You can't
[01:47] have it. Someone else has already got
[01:48] it. Wow. Wow's good, isn't it? Wow.
[01:51] You could have a business, couldn't you?
[01:53] Sonic. So, this is it. The boldest car
[01:55] on the road. Look, gloriously confident,
[01:58] unapologetic in its stance. Arguably the
[02:00] bravest thing Kia has ever done. And so
[02:03] far, it's working. But here's what I
[02:05] want to know. Why has it already won car
[02:08] of the year? And more importantly, does
[02:10] it tick every box for you?
[02:14] Even though this has a large opening
[02:17] area and it's high and square, this only
[02:20] has 1,500 L of space, which compared to
[02:23] a Range Rover, for example, which has I
[02:25] think that's 2,100. That is vast.
[02:28] Although this is half the price of a
[02:30] Range Rover, do you have cup holders in
[02:32] the back? A whole load of cup holders in
[02:34] the back. Do you have the seven seats
[02:36] that are actually like a human can sit
[02:38] in? And look, you can move them with
[02:41] this button. Hey, all of them move like
[02:43] this. And I'm now going to do the second
[02:45] row seat. And the biggest thing of all,
[02:47] you've got a 12vt charger here. This is
[02:50] brilliant. Look at this. And if you're
[02:52] going to compare this to something like
[02:53] an EX90, you are sitting a little bit
[02:56] lower. There is a thing though because
[02:58] when you get in this, it does a song and
[03:00] then it does this strange movement. I
[03:03] cannot emphasize enough how comfortable
[03:06] and how luxurious this seat is. It's
[03:09] even got this thing so that you can
[03:11] almost put your feet up. It'll come out
[03:13] there. Look. Look at that. Just a little
[03:15] bit of calf protection. And then when
[03:18] you move around,
[03:20] it moves in a way that I've not seen a
[03:22] car move before. So, it does move like
[03:24] that, but it's got this almost dentist
[03:26] chair electronical thing. Definitely got
[03:29] comfort and space, haven't they? That
[03:32] they've nailed that, haven't they? And
[03:33] they've got a Dr. Evil seat.
[03:36] It's the only seat in the world that you
[03:38] can turn around and tell the kids off.
[03:39] Now listen, I told you you can't. Or if
[03:41] you're camping, you can have the
[03:43] barbecue director sitting in this way.
[03:46] No, sausages don't go on yet. Le you
[03:48] will find yourself in one of these
[03:50] getting a lot of attention. People will
[03:52] let you out of junction so they can
[03:54] mainly cuz they can look at it. Of
[03:56] course, yes, you can have one of these
[03:57] for similar money maybe, but one of
[04:00] those comes with £11,000 worth of Yeah.
[04:03] interest, which is a lot of money you
[04:04] could spend on family days out
[04:07] and going to the zoo. But Anna doesn't
[04:10] mind. She she went with the Volvo.
[04:13] Here's how you get the seven seats
[04:15] working because look, I've put these
[04:17] twisted round. Yeah. Furniture. There we
[04:21] go. And this is the amount of room
[04:24] you'll get. You could even have No, you
[04:27] wouldn't want to do that. But I could
[04:28] probably move that back. Look, see how
[04:29] much room I've got? It's good. There's
[04:32] even a fan up here for your air con,
[04:34] lighting the aircraft. Just press the
[04:36] button if you need something. If you
[04:38] want someone, just press the button. If
[04:41] you look at this key, keys are very
[04:42] important cuz they are essentially the
[04:44] connection to your car when you're not
[04:45] in your car is your key. Where's my key?
[04:47] Oh, here it is. And look how it kind of
[04:50] tones in with the interior of the car.
[04:52] It's very nice. But there's a couple of
[04:54] buttons on this key here. One is this,
[04:56] and the other one is that. And
[04:58] essentially it means that you can pull
[05:00] into a car parking space, find the car
[05:02] parking space. If it's too narrow, you
[05:05] can get out and then use these buttons
[05:08] to move the car in and out. That is
[05:11] beautiful. You may never use that ever,
[05:14] but it's very good to show your friends.
[05:16] Speaking of your friends, they have
[05:17] their own air con here, which is a nice
[05:20] touch. Having it up in the ceiling is
[05:22] very unique. That's lovely. Air con on.
[05:25] And it comes out these nice fans here,
[05:27] too. And then there's plenty of light
[05:29] from the double pan roof. The materials
[05:31] are obviously made from special
[05:33] recyclable materials. So for example,
[05:35] the roof lining is made from plastic
[05:37] bottles. These seats are made from a
[05:39] very special biopolyure.
[05:42] The paint is made from rape seed oil.
[05:45] And the plastics are made from sugar
[05:47] cane.
[05:49] Yep. You could probably eat this. It's
[05:52] actually firm around town. You will feel
[05:55] some of the bumps. So, I'm just
[05:56] listening to the electric sounds. By the
[05:59] way, you can turn them completely off,
[06:00] but the electric sounds are the nicest
[06:03] I've heard in any car. And the reversing
[06:05] sound will almost send you to sleep.
[06:07] It's so calming. There's no way I'll be
[06:09] able to show you. I will try.
[06:17] [Music]
[06:23] BMW had to spend about a million quid on
[06:26] Han Zimmer. That sounds just as good.
[06:28] Here's how it fits in any car park.
[06:30] Look, just to show you the size. I did
[06:32] that. Deceptive, that, isn't it? I also
[06:34] parked it manually without using any of
[06:36] the digital things. Yes, weight saving
[06:38] wheel trims, right? Well, they're
[06:40] plastic, which means they could rattle
[06:43] if they come loose. Yeah, warranty
[06:46] though. Don't worry about that. Oh, and
[06:47] yes, uh, don't show that. That wasn't
[06:50] me. I don't know. Should we move on?
[06:52] What's next? Quietness. It is so quiet.
[06:56] Remarkably quiet considering the shape.
[07:00] You know, it's not the most aerodynamic
[07:02] car, is it? But they've even thought of
[07:04] that because there's a crosswind system.
[07:07] And that cross wind system, if you get a
[07:09] strong gust of wind, will take over the
[07:11] steering and the braking to stop you
[07:12] from, I don't know, flying off a bridge.
[07:16] And as you can hear now, the only thing
[07:17] I can hear is actually the fan. If I'll
[07:19] switch it off, we are completely in
[07:22] silence. Now, some of that might be to
[07:24] do with the foam in the tires. Some foam
[07:27] tires are good and some are not. But
[07:29] there's something else. The suspension
[07:31] geometry, they've done something to the
[07:33] suspension geometry, and that is
[07:36] probably affecting how noise gets into
[07:38] the cabin, too.
[07:42] Let me just walk you through real quick
[07:43] how different this is as a thing. First
[07:46] of all, the seating position and the way
[07:48] everything is laid out is very unusual.
[07:51] You've also got this unique thing which
[07:53] I'm sure you've seen on the internet
[07:54] before. If you want to select the gears,
[07:56] you make that little twist like that.
[07:59] This is your 360 camera, by the way. And
[08:01] then everything is new. It's like
[08:05] learning to drive all over again for
[08:07] some reason. Even the steering wheel,
[08:09] the thickness of this is amazing. It's
[08:11] flat at the top, flat at the bottom.
[08:13] Your drive mode is here. And there's
[08:14] your terrain mode. And here, of course,
[08:16] is your unique cup holders that can get
[08:18] larger or smaller. You've got a
[08:20] fingerprint thing so that you can have
[08:22] some security. And there's your wireless
[08:23] charger. The stereo is powered by
[08:25] Meridian, which is what they used to put
[08:27] in Land Rovers. And it all lights up at
[08:29] night. Plus, the maps are brilliant.
[08:33] Kia have made a choice in terms of the
[08:36] suspension which is to not put air
[08:38] suspension. This is normal suspension
[08:40] here. Relatively clever what they've
[08:42] done because they've taken into account
[08:44] the weight and the center of gravity
[08:47] because obviously it's an electric car.
[08:48] All the weight is lower, which means
[08:50] that you get less body roll if you tune
[08:52] the suspension correctly. And that's
[08:54] exactly what they've done. One way to
[08:55] look at this would be if you're carrying
[08:58] pints back to the table, the higher up
[09:00] they are, the more likely they are to
[09:02] spill. And if they're lower, yeah, it's
[09:06] not the most inconspicuous car, though,
[09:08] is it? I'm not sure if you're slightly
[09:10] shy, I'm not sure you could park this at
[09:12] the office without being triggered by
[09:14] someone saying something. Yeah, but at
[09:16] least you would have got there semi
[09:18] autonomously. Well, obviously there are
[09:19] cameras situated all over the car and
[09:21] and radar. And this is fantastic because
[09:24] it does a couple of unique things. The
[09:27] the standard things are, for example,
[09:29] this camera here where you can see your
[09:32] blind spot when you indicate. That's
[09:34] digital. There are uh obviously scanners
[09:36] to stop you from reversing into a
[09:38] cyclist. And blind spot monitors work
[09:41] very well to stop people from overtaking
[09:43] you on the left, which by the way in the
[09:45] UK you can do now on the M4. There's a
[09:47] lot of people doing that. There's
[09:48] obviously a new law. Anyway, this has
[09:51] got the obviously the auto cruise. So,
[09:53] let's press that on. Now, I'm going to
[09:55] put this on.
[09:57] And this does a number of things. So,
[10:00] first of all, it does something called
[10:02] NSC.
[10:04] Now, this means that the speed of the
[10:07] car will change in accordance with what
[10:11] it says the road should be. Now, not
[10:13] very many cars do that. So, you're in
[10:14] automatic cruise control. It will slow
[10:16] down or speed up. not with the other
[10:19] traffic, but because of the speed limit.
[10:21] Not enough cars do that. And it's also
[10:23] got something called NSCC,
[10:25] which is the National Society of Cruise
[10:28] Control. Not really. It actually means
[10:30] that it's also working with the
[10:32] navigation to slow down for corners.
[10:36] It pretty much does everything. Yeah.
[10:39] 65,000 we mentioned earlier on, that
[10:41] gets you the 200 horsepower. You want
[10:43] seven seats and 378 horsepower, then
[10:46] you're going to be spending 77,000. That
[10:48] changes things. Yes. And that 15-minute
[10:51] charge thing is only if you get 300 kW
[10:55] of charge, which in England, I don't
[10:57] know any human who's been able to get
[10:59] that. I mean, by all means, correct me
[11:00] if I'm wrong. Invite me to your charging
[11:02] network, but it would be nice if you
[11:04] could. I know that you can get those
[11:06] numbers in Norway. So, essentially, if
[11:07] you live in Norway, get one of these.
[11:10] Isn't that where Santa's from? I mean,
[11:12] or is it? No, that's the Northern Light.
[11:14] Maybe both. The Northern Lights, which
[11:16] can change color depending on the types
[11:18] of gases in the air. Well, so can this.
[11:20] Kia call their controllable one pedal
[11:22] drive, by the way, I pedal, which like
[11:25] the Northern Lights is also well quite
[11:27] heavenly. And they've also gone one
[11:29] further by reminding you cleverly what
[11:31] each pedal does by putting an icon on.
[11:33] See, so that one is slow down and that
[11:36] one is speed up. Now, just in case you
[11:38] forget. And so to the question, does it
[11:41] tick every box as you might expect for
[11:44] the world's most interesting car? Well,
[11:46] no. The boot isn't very big. It doesn't
[11:48] have air suspension as you would expect.
[11:50] And third, well, it's expensive. That
[11:53] said, 7-year warranty, world car of the
[11:55] year last year. It's faster than it
[11:57] should be and feels exceptionally
[12:00] premium. So, yes, it checks new boxes,
[12:04] and you probably won't get more car for
[12:06] less money.
