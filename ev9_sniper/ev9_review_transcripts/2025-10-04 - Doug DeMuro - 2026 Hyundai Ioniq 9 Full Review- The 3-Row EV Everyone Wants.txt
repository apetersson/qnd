[00:00] This is the new 2026 Hyundai Ionic 9,
[00:05] and it's a big deal. A fully electric
[00:08] SUV that combines three row seating with
[00:12] relatively affordable pricing. Now, that
[00:14] may not seem like a big deal, but it is.
[00:17] Until now, basically, no other EV has
[00:20] combined those things. So, today I'm
[00:23] going to review this, the new Ionic 9,
[00:26] and show you all of its quirks and
[00:28] features.

[00:51] I've had to deal with weird stuff.
[00:53] Random emails, odd messages, people
[00:55] digging too deeply. That's why I take

[01:49] quirks and features of the Ionic 9, the
[01:52] three row electric SUV. Now, if you
[01:55] haven't really been following along in
[01:57] this market, you'll probably be
[01:58] wondering what makes this so special.
[02:00] Why is that interesting? And it's just
[02:02] because, like I said, there haven't been
[02:04] that many fully electric three row SUVs.
[02:07] Most electric SUVs are smaller, two row,
[02:10] like the Tesla Model Y or the Ford
[02:12] Mustang Mach E or the Kia EV6. Now, the
[02:16] ones that have three rows have tended to
[02:18] be more expensive, like the Rivian R1S
[02:22] and the Tesla Model X. They exist, but
[02:24] they exist in a different price point.
[02:27] Now, this is more affordable than those.
[02:30] Sort of more in line with a traditional
[02:32] typical three row family SUV, and it's
[02:35] only real competition right now is the
[02:38] Kia EV9, which comes from Hyundai's
[02:41] sister brand, Kia. In fact, the Ionic 9
[02:43] and the EV9, they share mechanicals.
[02:46] They share a platform, battery
[02:48] technology, all that stuff. They're
[02:50] pretty similar. But while the EV9 is
[02:52] sort of a more quirky, kind of unusual
[02:54] design, this is intended to have a bit
[02:56] more of a luxury tilt compared to its
[03:00] Kia sibling. Now, I've already done a
[03:02] video with the Ionic 9 right when it was
[03:04] first revealed, but that was with a
[03:06] pre-production model. It wasn't fully
[03:08] ready. I couldn't show you everything,
[03:09] and I couldn't drive it. So today I'm
[03:12] going to do a full review starting with
[03:15] the quirks and features and starting
[03:17] specifically with the key which I love.
[03:20] It is this which is a Hyundai logo. It
[03:23] looks like an egg but if you look
[03:25] closely the Hyundai H is sort of in the
[03:27] negative space between the buttons,
[03:29] lock, unlock, all that stuff. And it is
[03:31] a really cool and clever key design that
[03:34] modern newer Hyundai models have. And I
[03:36] absolutely love that they did that. Now,
[03:39] the Hyundai logo key isn't the only
[03:41] unusual Hyundai logo in the Ioni 9.
[03:43] Another one is back here. The rear
[03:46] Hyundai logo is mounted sort of within
[03:49] the tailgate glass. It doesn't have like
[03:51] a raised emblem like in so many cars.
[03:53] It's just stuck in the glass. Definitely
[03:55] interesting and quirky. But the
[03:57] quirkiest quirk back here is undoubtedly
[04:00] the rear lighting situation in this car,
[04:03] which is completely made up of little
[04:05] boxes that go the entire way around the
[04:08] rear end, as you can see. Now, with the
[04:10] tail lights on, well, there's a lot of
[04:12] little rear boxes lit up. When you turn
[04:14] on the turn signals, you get even more
[04:17] little boxes. Now, they're flashing
[04:19] orange. Put on the brake lights, and
[04:20] again, more boxes. You can see on the
[04:22] top, the third brake light illuminates
[04:24] over the entire top and basically makes
[04:26] like a giant dome of little boxes in the
[04:30] back of this car. The whole thing is
[04:33] rather unusual. And the reverse lights
[04:35] are at the bottom integrated into the
[04:37] bumper. Again, in little tiny squares
[04:39] just like all the other lights in back.
[04:41] It is a very distinctive rear end design
[04:44] for this vehicle with its rather odd
[04:47] light boxes all around the rear end. And
[04:50] it's the same situation in front.
[04:52] Probably the most distinctive lighting
[04:54] element up front is the running light,
[04:56] which is a series of little light boxes
[04:59] running the entire front end of the
[05:01] vehicle from left to right, the whole
[05:03] front end all the way across, which is
[05:05] definitely unusual. Now, you put on the
[05:07] turn signal and you can see little light
[05:09] boxes light up on either side above and
[05:12] below the running light going across the
[05:15] entire car, which again is kind of
[05:17] unusual. And then the headlights which
[05:20] are down below in this area, they are
[05:22] also made up of a series of little light
[05:25] boxes. And then you have even more light
[05:27] boxes next to them. And well, there's
[05:29] just a lot of different little light
[05:31] squares on the outside of this car. This
[05:33] has been a theme that Hyundai has used,
[05:35] a design element in its Ionic models. We
[05:38] first saw it with the Ionic 5, which
[05:40] also had little squares basically
[05:42] everywhere, and they're carrying it into
[05:44] this car, too. It certainly separates
[05:46] them from other vehicles that don't have
[05:49] a lot of little squares all throughout
[05:51] the exterior and interior, which I'll
[05:53] show you in a second. But before we get
[05:55] in there, I should point out that the
[05:56] light squares are not the only unusual
[06:00] design element for this vehicle. There
[06:02] are a couple others. One obvious one,
[06:04] you look at it from the side, you can
[06:06] see there are little eyebrows over the
[06:09] wheels. This painted area over the wheel
[06:12] tire, it looks kind of like an eyebrow.
[06:14] It's set off from the wheel arch, which
[06:16] is black, kind of normal, but then
[06:17] there's this red body color piece.
[06:19] Really does look like eyebrows, and it
[06:21] certainly is kind of strange. But more
[06:23] unusual than that is definitely the
[06:25] overall profile of this vehicle. The
[06:28] Ionic 9 doesn't have your typical SUV
[06:30] shape. It's sort of teardrop shaped,
[06:32] which is odd to see in a larger three
[06:35] row SUV, unlike the Model Y or the Maki,
[06:38] where it's pretty common. Here, it's a
[06:40] little bit more unusual. this sort of
[06:41] windswept look brought to a vehicle this
[06:44] size. It definitely has a stranger
[06:46] profile almost sort of minivan or
[06:48] station wagonesesque. Although this is
[06:51] definitely a crossover in terms of
[06:53] sizing, dimensions and driving position.
[06:55] Still, it has a distinctive shape and it
[06:57] is absolutely not just another boring
[07:00] generic SUV on the road. You will notice
[07:03] this. It certainly looks different from
[07:05] other vehicles. But anyway, next time to
[07:08] climb inside the Ionic 9. When you
[07:10] unlock the doors, the door handles pop
[07:13] out, which is a nice luxurious touch.
[07:15] You pull on them, you open the door, you
[07:17] get inside, and you see the
[07:19] luxuriousness continues in here. It's
[07:22] actually surprisingly nice in this
[07:24] cabin. This is an upscale,
[07:26] well-designed, high-end interior. Not
[07:28] really what you'd associate necessarily
[07:30] with Hyundai, but it certainly does have
[07:32] the luxury tilt compared to its platform
[07:35] sister, the Kia EV9. Like I mentioned
[07:36] before, this is a nice highquality
[07:39] luxurious place to spend time. And yet,
[07:42] in spite of that, it's relatively
[07:44] affordable. Now, I say relatively
[07:46] because the Ionic 9 starts around
[07:48] $58,000, which is still pretty
[07:50] expensive. But as far as three row SUVs
[07:54] go, that's kind of the territory where
[07:55] they're in. It's a little pricier than
[07:57] stuff like the Hyundai Palisade or Kia
[07:59] Tellide, but it's not crazy
[08:01] off-the-charts expensive, particularly
[08:03] when you compare it to other three row
[08:06] electric SUVs. Like I mentioned before,
[08:08] the Rivian R1S starts at almost $80,000
[08:12] compared to 58 for this. The new Volvo
[08:14] EX90, also a three row electric SUV,
[08:17] that starts at over $81,000.
[08:20] Most of its competition is vastly more
[08:22] expensive, and so this is relatively
[08:24] affordable. Now, this particular model,
[08:26] I should point out, has a sticker price
[08:28] of around $72,000
[08:30] equipped this way. But beyond that
[08:32] stuff, let's move on to all of the
[08:34] interesting quirks. Starting with the
[08:36] very unusual gear selector, which pops
[08:39] out from the steering column. It's this
[08:41] large thing, looks like almost a
[08:42] doublesiz turn signal stock, and you
[08:45] select the gear by twisting the switch
[08:47] at the end. So, you pull it towards you
[08:49] for reverse, you pull it forward for
[08:51] drive, and park is a little button at
[08:53] the end of the stock. very unusual.
[08:55] Strangely, this stock also incorporates
[08:57] the start stop button to turn on the
[08:59] car. You press it here and that starts
[09:01] things up and then you can drive from
[09:03] there. Now, beyond that quirk, let's
[09:05] move on to the squares. Like you saw on
[09:07] the outside with the lighting up front
[09:09] and in back, there are more squares up
[09:11] here. Starting on the steering wheel
[09:13] where you have four squares instead of
[09:15] the brand's logo or the brand's name or
[09:18] Ionic 9, just four squares. Now, four
[09:21] dots is Morse code for H. And of course,
[09:24] Hyundai starts with H. So, in addition
[09:26] to the sort of square theme that also
[09:30] actually makes an H. Sort of a clever
[09:32] little touch for this car. But you see
[09:33] these squares everywhere. Look in the
[09:35] center console and you can see around
[09:36] the wireless charger, just little rubber
[09:38] squares all over to keep your phone in
[09:40] place. You look in the cup holder. Same
[09:42] deal. Circles for cups, but squares on
[09:44] the inside. Now, speaking of this center
[09:47] console, it's actually pretty clever
[09:49] because it moves. You can reach your
[09:51] hand under here. There's a little latch
[09:54] and then you can move the center console
[09:56] forward or backward depending on who
[09:58] needs access. If rear passengers need
[09:59] access, you can slide it back there so
[10:01] they can get it. If you want it up front
[10:03] for easier access to your drink or your
[10:04] charging phone, you have it up here as
[10:07] well, which is a pretty nifty little
[10:08] trick. Also, a rather exciting trick in
[10:11] this vehicle is that the seats have
[10:13] power operated leg rests. This little
[10:17] switch on the side of the seat will move
[10:19] forward a leg rest so that you can have
[10:21] your legs be comforted and the seat can
[10:25] fully recline. So, you can recline this
[10:27] like an airplane seat, like a first
[10:29] class airplane seat. Recline it back
[10:31] with the leg rest out and you can just
[10:33] lie down here. Obviously, not while
[10:35] you're driving, but if you want to stop
[10:37] and take a rest on a long road trip, or
[10:39] you're just waiting for your kids to
[10:40] finish with their sports practice, you
[10:43] can do that in the front seats, which is
[10:45] a pretty neat touch of this car. Adds to
[10:47] sort of the relaxing luxury atmosphere
[10:50] of this interior. Next up, we move on to
[10:52] some of the tech features, starting with
[10:54] the climate control, which is
[10:55] interesting. You operate it with a
[10:57] screen in the center, but it's not like
[10:59] a touchcreen that's integrated into the
[11:01] overall screen system. So you go through
[11:03] menus. Instead, it's fixed in place.
[11:05] Just instead of buttons, you have this
[11:07] little screen. It works reasonably well.
[11:09] And it's kind of a cool operation. When
[11:11] you press something and tap it and
[11:13] select it, these little blue ripples
[11:15] kind of appear where you've pressed to
[11:17] sort of confirm your selection, which is
[11:19] kind of a neat little quirk of this
[11:21] vehicle. Now, moving on to the overall
[11:23] infotainment screen in the center. It's
[11:26] excellent. Its operation is very easy,
[11:28] very high quality, immediately responds
[11:30] to your touch. You have a big screen
[11:31] with great resolution. You can easily
[11:33] have whatever you want right at your
[11:35] fingertips. It's all a very good setup
[11:37] for the infotainment. And it has some
[11:40] interesting quirks. For one, there's a
[11:42] sports tab, I guess, within this
[11:44] infotainment screen. You can tap on it
[11:47] and you can instantly select which
[11:49] league you want to see, basketball,
[11:51] baseball, whatever, and get scores. Or
[11:53] if that sport isn't playing, it actually
[11:55] tells you that it's in the off season
[11:57] currently. Just so you know, don't go
[12:00] looking for hockey scores in the summer.
[12:02] Another interesting quirk of this
[12:03] infotainment system is that the radio
[12:05] allows you to access your typical AMFM,
[12:08] satellite radio, Bluetooth, etc. Or you
[12:10] can turn on the sounds of nature, which
[12:13] are preloaded nature sounds that come
[12:16] with the car, and you can select them
[12:18] and listen as you drive. Take a listen
[12:21] to autumn sentiments for a minute.
[12:26] All
[12:32] [Music]
[12:38] right, next up we move on to the gauge
[12:40] cluster, which is about the same size as
[12:42] the center infotainment screen, although
[12:44] obviously right in front of the steering
[12:46] wheel for the driver. Now, the gauge
[12:48] cluster I don't quite like as much as
[12:50] the infotainment system because it just
[12:52] doesn't provide enough information, at
[12:54] least in my view. You can't configure it
[12:56] like I wish you could to show like the
[12:58] map for the navigation system right in
[13:01] your line of sight like some cars offer.
[13:03] You also can't even have your music
[13:05] displayed here very easily, let alone
[13:06] both of those things like you can in
[13:08] some cars. I'm a little disappointed
[13:10] with the Hyundai and Kia gauge cluster
[13:12] screen setup. You just don't get that
[13:14] much stuff here. With that said, there
[13:16] are a couple of cool things integrated
[13:18] into the gauge cluster, even though you
[13:20] don't have everything. One, the driving
[13:22] range on electric. Now, all electric
[13:25] cars have this. It shows you how many
[13:26] miles till empty. But the cool thing
[13:28] here is it gives you a minimum and a
[13:30] maximum driving range. So, a minimum,
[13:33] like if you drove it crazy and turned on
[13:35] all the air conditioning, how far would
[13:36] the least amount you could go be? And
[13:39] then maximum obviously is if you drove
[13:41] the most efficiently as possible, turned
[13:43] off everything, how far could you go? I
[13:45] actually like seeing this range. Of
[13:46] course, it gives you a specific overall
[13:48] number, but the range is kind of helpful
[13:51] to understand, hey, if I really wanted
[13:53] to run the climate controls and drive
[13:55] fast, even then I'll still go this far.
[13:57] It kind of helps with range anxiety. The
[13:59] other cool thing in the gauge cluster
[14:01] screen is that when you put on the turn
[14:03] signals, you get little cameras that pop
[14:05] on to show you what's in your blind
[14:07] spot. So, if you're making a lane
[14:08] change, the blind spot camera comes on
[14:10] and shows you what vehicle is over
[14:12] there. And you can do that on both
[14:13] sides. actually very helpful and a
[14:15] pretty impressive safety feature you get
[14:17] in a lot of new Hyundai and Kia models
[14:18] and I really wish that would spread to
[14:20] other cars throughout the industry
[14:22] because it really is impressively
[14:24] useful. And next we move on to the back
[14:26] seat which is really impressively roomy.
[14:29] There is a lot of space for rear seat
[14:32] passengers back here. Leg room,
[14:33] headroom, all of it. Despite that sort
[14:35] of teardrop shape of the vehicle, it
[14:37] really does seem very large, very roomy
[14:39] back here. lot of space to kind of sit
[14:41] back, relax, chill. And the rear seats
[14:45] do the cool recline thing that the front
[14:47] seats did, too, where you have that
[14:49] power operated leg rest. It can swing
[14:51] forward, the seat can recline all the
[14:53] way back, and so even rear seat
[14:55] passengers can sit back here and recline
[14:58] to comfort again while the car is
[14:59] parked, but sit back here and really
[15:01] enjoy sort of a luxury nap in the back
[15:04] of the Ionic 9. And there are other nice
[15:07] touches, too. You can see the rear seat
[15:09] climate controls back here. Pretty
[15:11] standard par for the course on vehicles
[15:13] like this at this price point. But one
[15:15] nice thing is heated rear seats and
[15:17] ventilated rear seats, which you don't
[15:19] always get. Plus, there are other cool
[15:21] touches, including a rear window sun
[15:23] shade. You have it on both sides. You
[15:25] can put the sun shade up to keep out the
[15:26] sun. Obviously, especially useful for
[15:28] infants or little children. And rear
[15:30] passengers can open up the front center
[15:33] console storage compartment. They press
[15:36] this little button and then this storage
[15:38] compartment opens from the rear in
[15:40] addition to front seat passengers
[15:41] accessing it from the front. It is a
[15:44] cool magical compartment you can get at
[15:46] from both sides which is neat. Also cool
[15:48] in this center console and again
[15:50] remember it can slide backwards if you
[15:52] need it a little closer. But also cool
[15:54] back here is a storage compartment for
[15:57] rear seat passengers. It's built in. You
[15:58] have this little handle. You kind of
[16:00] pull it open and then you have some
[16:01] extra rear seat storage back here which
[16:04] is great. Now, not quite so great is the
[16:06] cup holder game in back. You do have cup
[16:09] holders, but they are only in the doors,
[16:11] and they're a little small. You can see
[16:13] kind of two here on this side, and then
[16:15] you can maybe get another cup down in
[16:17] this bottom area. You don't have central
[16:19] cup holders like you do in so many cars
[16:21] with these captain's chairs. Instead,
[16:23] there's a little aisle for passing
[16:25] through to the rear seats, which is also
[16:27] useful, but so would more cup holders
[16:29] be. Anyway, speaking of the rear seats,
[16:32] the third row in this vehicle, access is
[16:35] quite easy, at least in this Limited
[16:36] model with power seats. You just push
[16:38] this button and the seat automatically
[16:40] folds itself and slides forward. You
[16:42] don't have to do anything else. It's all
[16:44] done for you. Once that happens, of
[16:46] course, you just get into the third row.
[16:47] And you can see they're pretty decent.
[16:49] They're not huge in back, leg room, or
[16:51] headroom, but enough space for children,
[16:53] which is typically who rides back there.
[16:55] Totally acceptable. And you have some
[16:57] decent amenities in back like cup
[16:59] holders individual to both rear seats
[17:02] which is nice. You have a USBC port on
[17:04] both side for charging devices which is
[17:06] cool. And you can of course push the
[17:08] button in the second row to powerfold
[17:10] the seat in order to climb out from the
[17:12] third row which makes life pretty easy
[17:14] to get out of that third row seat. Now
[17:16] one drawback in this interior is that
[17:18] you don't have a household style power
[17:20] port in the second or third row like a
[17:23] typical plug-in power port. Should be
[17:25] pointed out in the second row, you do
[17:27] have USBC ports as well on the backs of
[17:29] the front seats, which again is nice for
[17:31] charging devices, just like in the third
[17:33] row, but no typical household port like
[17:35] we're starting to see in more and more
[17:37] vehicles that would maximize
[17:38] convenience. And next up, we move on to
[17:41] the cargo area in the Ionic 9, which I
[17:44] must say isn't exactly ideal. There is
[17:47] good space behind the third row.
[17:49] Actually, a surprising amount of space
[17:51] back here. But because of the teardrop
[17:54] shape, you are kind of closed in. If you
[17:57] have larger items, taller stuff, you
[18:00] might not be able to fit it in or fit a
[18:02] lot of stuff on top of each other.
[18:03] Because of that shape, kind of pinching
[18:05] the rear cargo area from above. It's a
[18:07] little bit of a drawback. Now, you do
[18:09] have extra cargo space below. You can
[18:12] see the floor lifts up, but when you
[18:13] lift it up, you find there's not
[18:15] particularly much more space. It's only
[18:18] a little bit of extra space. Doesn't
[18:20] really get you that much more cargo
[18:21] volume. Now, it's worth pointing out you
[18:24] can easily fold the second and third row
[18:27] seats from back here. So, if you don't
[18:29] have passengers in all the seats, you
[18:30] can easily just press these buttons. The
[18:32] seats fold and you instantly have access
[18:34] to a far larger cargo compartment, which
[18:36] is nice. Also worth pointing out back
[18:39] here, you do have a power port. Just
[18:41] like I mentioned, is missing from the
[18:43] second and third row seats. Well, here
[18:45] you have it in the back. A typical
[18:46] household style plug-in power port. It's
[18:49] great to have in the cargo area, but it
[18:51] would be a little bit nicer if you also
[18:53] had an additional one in the interior
[18:55] itself that would maximize convenience a
[18:57] little bit more. And finally, on the
[18:59] subject of cargo storage, let's talk
[19:02] about the front compartment. Obviously,
[19:03] an electric vehicle, no engine in here.
[19:05] Instead, you have a cargo compartment.
[19:08] You open it up and you can see, well,
[19:11] there's a little storage area under
[19:13] here, big enough to fit these bags,
[19:14] which contain the charging cables, but
[19:17] not much bigger than that. It's not huge
[19:19] up front. It's still decent sized. It
[19:21] just isn't really massive. Still nice to
[19:23] have extra storage up front. Also, up
[19:26] front, you can see this vented area in
[19:28] front of the cargo compartment. Again,
[19:30] tiny squares everywhere because that is
[19:33] a theme of the carried into every part,
[19:35] including the front trunk. Now, since
[19:38] I'm up here, usually I talk about
[19:40] engines. This car doesn't have one, but
[19:42] let's talk performance nonetheless.
[19:44] There are three different levels of
[19:46] Ionic 9 performance. The base model has
[19:49] about 215 horsepower and frontwheel
[19:52] drive. That's the one that starts around
[19:54] $58,000. Now, from there, you can step
[19:57] up to a mid-level version that has about
[20:00] 300 horsepower, which strikes me as
[20:02] about all you need in a vehicle like
[20:04] this. That's sort of where all the
[20:05] mid-trim models are. This particular
[20:07] version is the top trim performance
[20:09] model. Has about 420 horsepower, which
[20:13] is nice and muscular, but maybe not
[20:15] really essential for a three row family
[20:17] SUV. This one does 0 to 60 in about 4.4
[20:22] seconds, which is pretty quick for a
[20:23] vehicle like this. Again, maybe not
[20:25] entirely necessary, but neat to have. On
[20:28] the subject of performance, well, let's
[20:31] see how it performs. I'm eager to check
[20:33] it out, get it out on the road, get
[20:34] behind the wheel, and see how it drives.
[20:37] So, let's do it. All right, driving the
[20:39] Ionic 9. This is if you're in the market
[20:43] for a family electric SUV, this is
[20:46] probably one of your most desired kind
[20:48] of most long awaited vehicles because
[20:51] it's sort of like a nice luxury three
[20:53] row. Not that crazy expensive like some
[20:56] of the other ones. Like this kind of
[20:57] checks all the boxes for a decent amount
[21:00] of people. I know there's not a lot of
[21:01] people looking for electric three row,
[21:03] but there's a decent amount and there's
[21:05] basically nothing out there unless you
[21:07] want to spend really crazy money or
[21:08] compromise on the electric thing. and
[21:10] like get a plug-in hybrid like a
[21:12] Pacifica or something like that or a T
[21:13] Lexus TX. This really does it all and I
[21:15] got to say it does it well. Um there's a
[21:18] lot a lot a lot of stuff that I like
[21:20] about this vehicle. Um I love the ride.
[21:22] I love the driving experience. It is
[21:24] very comfortable, very smooth in here.
[21:26] Um the Kia EV9, like I mentioned, is
[21:29] sort of the plat shares its platform and
[21:31] its mechanicals with this car, but the
[21:33] EV9 has sort of a more funky design, a
[21:35] more funky interior. It's pitched, I
[21:37] think, for more of like a, oh, this is
[21:39] cool and quirky kind of crowd, and this
[21:41] is more of like a serious sort of luxury
[21:43] kind of crowd. And that's exactly what
[21:45] they respectively deliver. This car has
[21:48] a pretty like luxurious, smooth, quiet,
[21:50] kind of nice feel to it. Um, and the EV9
[21:54] does well, but this one definitely is
[21:55] more in that direction. And it really is
[21:58] quiet. It's a nice quiet ride. I will
[22:00] say the um the ride quality isn't like
[22:03] an ultra luxury car. All right. I think
[22:05] that the Lexus TX rides better. I think
[22:07] that Mercedes-Benz GLE, for example, and
[22:09] GLS, which are not electric, they ride
[22:11] better. This isn't quite on the level of
[22:13] like those lux true luxury cars from
[22:15] luxury brands, but you're also not
[22:17] paying that kind of money. I mean, this
[22:18] one at $70 some,000 is very expensive.
[22:21] But when you look at where those
[22:23] vehicles are priced that the Volvo EX90
[22:25] starts above $81,000 and then, you know,
[22:28] you get a well equipped, you're into the
[22:29] '90s, like this actually has a pretty
[22:31] good uh price and price point
[22:34] considering all the equipment you get
[22:36] and considering how it drives and feels.
[22:38] Now, I will say earlier I floored the
[22:39] accelerator, really punched it, and it
[22:41] is quick. Um, but I have a suspicion
[22:43] that virtually nobody who has one of
[22:45] these vehicles will ever experience
[22:47] that. It's just not really worth uh even
[22:51] getting into the whole acceleration
[22:52] thing. It's fast. 0 to 60 in the low
[22:54] fours, I think, low to mid-4s, which is
[22:56] great. Um, but ultimately, you know,
[22:58] this is a midsize family kind of
[23:00] vehicle. And I will say to that end,
[23:02] there's no real need to buy the
[23:04] performance model as a result. Um, this
[23:05] one with it 70ome,000 price tag is
[23:07] expensive, but you really don't have to
[23:09] go this high. I think you could get one
[23:11] of these pretty nice in the '60s,
[23:13] compromise on power and performance,
[23:14] which is obviously totally fine in a in
[23:16] a family vehicle like this. There's just
[23:18] so much to love about this car. You have
[23:20] a great interior, you have great
[23:21] technology, nice roomy space in here.
[23:24] Um, drives well, good performance,
[23:26] relatively good price tag, and obviously
[23:28] full electric. I mean, this car, not
[23:30] only is it sort of the only game in town
[23:32] when it comes to a relatively affordable
[23:34] three row family EV SUV, but it's also
[23:38] good. Like, it doesn't have to be good.
[23:39] good. I think people would buy it just
[23:40] cuz it's sort of the default, like the
[23:42] only choice. Um, but it's also like
[23:44] quite a good vehicle. Quite a desirable,
[23:46] good, legitimately nice vehicle. And
[23:48] although these top trim levels, the
[23:50] limited, this one, the calligraphy, are
[23:51] really nice, they do start to get
[23:53] spendy, especially for a Hyundai. And
[23:54] some of the stuff that it adds,
[23:56] especially the performance, I'm not sure
[23:57] is necessary for most people. I think a
[23:59] lot of people could be totally happy in
[24:01] this vehicle uh grabbing uh you know
[24:04] kind of a low mid-trim model getting a
[24:06] little less power, a little less stuff
[24:08] and just cruising around with their
[24:09] kids. I I think uh this this car checks
[24:11] a lot of boxes for a lot of families and
[24:13] it's great to see a three row entrant in
[24:16] this segment and it's especially one
[24:17] that's that's this high quality and this
[24:19] good. I did the preview video of this
[24:21] right when it was announced a few months
[24:22] ago back in November I guess actually.
[24:24] So, almost a year getting up and it was
[24:26] great and it seemed like it was going to
[24:28] be great. And indeed, getting in this
[24:30] car and using it and experiencing it, it
[24:32] is even better than I was thinking it
[24:34] would be then. Um, just because it
[24:36] drives so well. It just feels like such
[24:38] a competent vehicle. So smooth, so
[24:40] quiet, so relatively, you know, decent
[24:42] seating position as an SUV. I just think
[24:44] it it checks so many of the great right
[24:46] boxes that people are exactly looking
[24:48] for if they're interested in buying a
[24:49] car like this. And so that's the new
[24:53] 2026 Hyundai Ionic 9. There's a lot to
[24:57] like here as this combines a roomy
[24:59] interior with relatively affordable
[25:01] pricing, good tech, luxury, and a full
[25:06] electric driving experience with good
[25:07] performance and range. This will surely
[25:10] be a hit, especially because it's
[25:12] basically the only vehicle that does it
[25:14] all right now. Anyway, now it's time to
[25:17] give the Ionic 9 a Doug score.
[25:24] And the Doug score is here. 54 out of
[25:26] 100, which puts the Ionic 9 here against
[25:28] rivals. Yes, the Rivian R1S and Volvo
[25:31] EX90 are ranked higher, but they're also
[25:33] way more expensive. If you can afford
[25:35] them, buy them. Otherwise, the Ionic 9
[25:37] provides an excellent compromise for
[25:39] people interested in a full electric SUV
[25:41] and a practical three row model offering
[25:44] reasonable pricing, a luxury feel, good
[25:46] tech, and a big interior. here.
