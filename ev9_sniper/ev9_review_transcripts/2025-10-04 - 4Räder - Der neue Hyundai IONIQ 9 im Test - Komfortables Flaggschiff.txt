[00:00] It is large, looks futuristic and
[00:02] aims to offer a great deal of comfort.
[00:05] The Ionic 9 marks the new
[00:07] spearhead of Hyundai’s electric range
[00:09] . Find out what the large SUV can and
[00:12] perhaps can't do
[00:13] in the detailed test report here
[00:16] at vier Räder. Have fun.
[00:18] Hyundai is adding to its all-electric
[00:20] Ionic model family. After the
[00:24] numbers 5 and 6, it is now the turn of the nine, with plenty of time
[00:27] . This makes it
[00:29] clear that we are dealing with the
[00:31] flagship here. In keeping with the fact
[00:34] that the odd numbers are
[00:36] meant to represent SUVs, the model shown for the first time in 2024 is
[00:43] designed in the format of a large SUV. With the Ionic 9, or Ionic 9 as
[00:47] you would like to pronounce it, yes, it looks as if
[00:49] the study rolled directly onto the road
[00:51] . I find the car so futuristic
[00:53] . The pixel LED elements that we
[00:56] see up here in this bar, which
[00:58] is covered in plastic,
[01:00] are typical for the Ionic
[01:02] model family.
[01:03] For example, up here there are the indicators
[01:06] and also the daytime running lights. We
[01:08] also have a lighting system that comes as
[01:11] standard. The car has
[01:13] a Morse code, for example, for the
[01:16] H, the first letter of Hyundai.
[01:18] also quite interesting. This is how
[01:19] the car greets you. The actual
[01:21] headlights are also always LEDs
[01:23] and they are located here at the bottom, they are
[01:25] installed here vertically, also with these
[01:27] pixel-like elements, you could
[01:30] say. There you will find MatrixLED LED
[01:32] if you choose the middle technology variant
[01:34] . We have the best
[01:36] version here, the Unique. He'll have them
[01:37] with him anyway. Otherwise, there is
[01:39] also a generous amount of glazing here in the middle;
[01:42] you could almost say it
[01:43] was glass, but of course it isn't glass.
[01:45] We also have various sensors
[01:47] underneath. Here, for example, is the camera for
[01:48] the 360° system. Um and below there is
[01:52] a special feature of the
[01:54] Unique, the best version.
[01:56] It has the Calligraphy
[01:58] design elements and they look a
[02:00] bit more elegant, while
[02:02] the basic variants, for example, have a slightly more
[02:04] plastic-heavy, i.e. unpainted
[02:06] plastic, for example we have here below,
[02:08] here in the Calligraph we have more
[02:10] body color and here below another
[02:12] black element in this suggested
[02:14] underbody protection. And the car has a
[02:17] width of 1.98 m,
[02:20] measured without exterior mirrors.
[02:23] Round and square combined, the Ionic has a
[02:25] special design, but also a
[02:27] sheer size. The car is
[02:29] exactly 5 m and 6 cm long.
[02:32] For example, a Mercedes S-Class is that long,
[02:34] so you can get a size comparison of
[02:36] this car. There is a special
[02:38] design in the vehicle, as mentioned, round
[02:40] and square combined. For example, there is a
[02:44] rear section that slopes slightly backwards. So the roof runs in an
[02:47] arch, basically has its peak here at the level of the
[02:49] B-pillar a little behind it
[02:51] and then flows downwards.
[02:53] Likewise, there is a
[02:55] beautiful silver strip around the windows
[02:57] , which is always standard, and at the
[02:59] back it runs into a
[03:01] large element. and then it increases
[03:04] a little bit. The
[03:06] car also has strong shoulders and
[03:08] a very interesting crease in the
[03:09] side that starts here at the front in
[03:12] the fender, then
[03:13] extends backwards below the mirrors and
[03:15] then ends again at the back. So
[03:18] the whole car runs and looks very
[03:20] curved and very elegant.
[03:22] The Ionic always has 9
[03:25] door handles that extend electrically
[03:27] as soon as you approach the car and
[03:29] retract as soon as you drive off or
[03:31] lock the car. This is
[03:33] done quite interestingly. This makes them
[03:35] very robust to grip. Very good,
[03:37] one could say. What I find a bit of a shame is that
[03:39] if it hits a bit harder
[03:41] ,
[03:43] the door will wobble a bit. Maybe that should
[03:44] n't be the case. Nevertheless,
[03:46] they seem to be ergonomically good. I have this problem with
[03:47] other vehicles, especially
[03:48] electric vehicles, which often
[03:50] have recessed door handles. From another
[03:53] perspective, Ionic 9 is also
[03:55] on it. Then you know where to get in.
[03:56] So a nice story and also very
[03:58] interesting. Uh, we don't have them
[04:00] , but for the highest trim
[04:01] level, for the Unique, there are
[04:03] also digital exterior mirrors, i.e.
[04:06] mirror cameras. The two cars aren't
[04:08] there, so I can't show them to you.
[04:10] We go a little further down
[04:11] and come to the sill. The car
[04:13] always has this black stripe
[04:14] here on the side, just above the
[04:16] sill. In our version it is
[04:19] shiny. In the basic version it would be
[04:20] matt black.
[04:22] Underneath, the car color is always nice here in the
[04:25] sill. I think that looks very,
[04:26] very chic. Um, otherwise
[04:28] let's get back to the colors of the
[04:30] vehicle. Sunset Brown Metallic is
[04:33] also a very nice color as standard.
[04:34] Then there are nine paint finishes that
[04:36] are optional. Three of these are
[04:39] matted, but these are only available from
[04:41] the middle variant Technik onwards. We
[04:43] have the beautiful Celladon Grey Metallic
[04:46] with us. By the way, this is also available in
[04:47] Matte. But we have it here in the
[04:49] shiny version. Um, for example,
[04:52] we also have the sills and the
[04:54] wheel arch trim much more in the
[04:56] body color here on the Unique variant.
[04:58] This is not the case in the cheaper versions either
[05:00] . The basic version,
[05:01] for example, has the black trim. In
[05:05] this town hall, in these wheel houses,
[05:09] rims of different sizes rotate. It starts at 19 inches,
[05:11] then goes over 20 inches in the second version
[05:13] and we have the 21 inch rims
[05:16] , which I still find very subtle
[05:18] . uh very nice with this
[05:20] look here with the fine spokes. This
[05:22] somewhat conceals the
[05:23] sheer size of the rim. When you look at
[05:25] the rear of the Ionic 9, you'll
[05:28] notice the boattail rear
[05:30] end, as
[05:32] the car tapers towards the rear. The car gets
[05:34] a bit narrower towards the rear. The
[05:36] rear is kept relatively low
[05:37] and looks a bit
[05:39] like a boat tail, which
[05:41] also contributes to the aerodynamics.
[05:43] We’ll look at that again at the end. We have
[05:45] a surrounding light strip on
[05:47] this car. Also very very
[05:49] interestingly done, right? Here, for example,
[05:51] everything is LED, including indicators,
[05:53] reversing lights, and so on. You can see it
[05:55] now, very interestingly
[05:56] done. Otherwise the rear is kept very smooth
[05:59] . We have the disc here.
[06:01] By the way, the windshield wiper is also located
[06:02] up here. It's also pretty
[06:05] big, you could say, right?
[06:07] Um, it's completely hidden. Uh, the
[06:09] disc is otherwise very smooth.
[06:10] The Hyundai logo is included in the window
[06:12] and the privacy glazing
[06:14] is standard in the Ionic 9, i.e. the
[06:16] tinted windows from the B-pillar onwards. Then
[06:19] here Ionic 9 again as a lettering
[06:21] or Ionic 9 if you
[06:23] want to pronounce it. Then here is
[06:25] the camera unfortunately without any protection, but with
[06:27] a small washer nozzle attached. And
[06:29] here, by the way, is the opening option
[06:30] for the tailgate. You have to
[06:31] know first, right? This beautiful
[06:33] black strip is embedded. At the bottom of the
[06:34] bumper there is also a small
[06:36] demarcation for our top variant, the
[06:38] Unique. With the Unique we have
[06:40] more car color here, for example in the
[06:42] middle, and shiny black
[06:43] plastic. In a
[06:45] cheaper version it doesn't look quite as
[06:47] elegant, but I find
[06:49] the CW value of the vehicle very elegant, because you
[06:50] might be thinking, oh my god, that's
[06:52] a massive thing, it certainly has
[06:53] a CW value like a wall unit. He did
[06:55] n't. It does have a large
[06:56] frontal area, which of course also
[06:58] affects fuel consumption, but it has a drag coefficient of
[07:00] 0.259,
[07:02] or just under 0.26, which is
[07:05] really good for a vehicle of this size. Please note,
[07:07] however, that this CW value
[07:09] only applies in conjunction with the digital
[07:12] exterior mirrors, not with our
[07:13] haptic mirrors. But I think it
[07:15] would only get worse to around 0.27
[07:18] . For European
[07:21] design tastes, the Ionic 9 is quite
[07:24] bulky. But the car is pleasing with its combination of round
[07:26] and square elements
[07:29] . The main focus of the
[07:32] large electric SUV will not be on the
[07:35] European or even German market,
[07:38] but rather on South Korea and the USA
[07:40] , where the model is also produced
[07:43] . But even here in Germany it shows the
[07:45] maximum that Hyundai
[07:48] is now capable of. If you
[07:52] see me sitting here at the back on the loading sill, then you already know in this
[07:54] chapter, okay, there is
[07:55] n't much to see under the hood.
[07:57] That's true with the Ionic, no, but only to
[07:59] a limited extent. We have a Frank
[08:00] with us at this car, you can see him
[08:01] now. It opens
[08:03] electrically. We also have a small
[08:04] emergency opening in the footwell and it has a
[08:06] volume of between 88 l and 52 l. That
[08:10] depends on whether you have a motor in the front
[08:12] . So the all-wheel drive variants
[08:13] only have the smaller Frank, the
[08:15] rear-wheel drive variants the slightly
[08:16] larger Frank. That's why we
[08:19] also have a few functions that
[08:21] you're familiar with in the front of a car,
[08:22] such as filling up the
[08:24] windshield washer fluid. The Ionic 9
[08:26] is based on the EGMP platform. This is
[08:28] the electric platform from the Hyundai
[08:31] Group. The car is therefore not available
[08:32] with combustion engines, but only as an
[08:34] electric vehicle. The car is available in
[08:37] three versions. First, there is the
[08:39] basic version with rear-wheel drive and
[08:41] 218 hp, and then there is the
[08:45] version with all-wheel drive, which
[08:46] we have today with 307 hp. There is
[08:50] also a performance version of this all-wheel drive variant
[08:51] , which has
[08:53] 428 hp. The battery has a constant capacity of 110
[08:58] cowatts, so it is very large, and
[09:00] of course the car only has a single-speed
[09:02] automatic transmission because the
[09:04] vehicle simply does not need more than that. In my test
[09:06] today we have the middle version
[09:08] and I find it very useful.
[09:10] We have an electric motor at the front with 66 kW, and
[09:13] here at the back we have one with 160 kW,
[09:16] resulting in a
[09:17] system output of 226 kW or 307 hp.
[09:23] That was a lot of numbers.
[09:25] The massive torque of 607 newm is also very interesting.
[09:28] And as is typical with electric vehicles,
[09:30] this happens immediately. This allows
[09:33] this
[09:35] large and heavy car to accelerate from
[09:37] 0 to 100 km/h in 6.7 seconds. And the speed limit
[09:40] on the motorway is
[09:42] 200 km/h. In the WLTP Mix, the Ionic 9
[09:46] with this engine or this variant is expected to
[09:52] consume between 20.4 and 20.6 cowatt hours per 100 km and the stated
[09:54] range on one battery charge is
[09:56] 606 km. This large Hyundai SUV shows
[10:01] what's possible. That's how you could describe it,
[10:04] because we actually only have the
[10:05] normal EGMP base, which
[10:07] the Ionic 5 and other vehicles
[10:10] from the group also have. Um, but it takes
[10:13] the whole thing to the extreme and
[10:15] that's what a flagship is supposed to do.
[10:17] Purely in terms of the engine or the engines -
[10:19] in our case we have two
[10:20] because we have all-wheel drive - 307 hp as a
[10:23] total output isn't that
[10:25] crazy. Especially for a car that
[10:26] weighs between 2.6 and 2.8 tons. That's what
[10:30] the Ionic 9 does. That's quite
[10:32] something. Nevertheless, it accelerates
[10:34] quickly. I can
[10:35] let myself fall back a little and turn
[10:37] it all the way. And it's moving
[10:39] along really quickly, I must say.
[10:40] You can quickly exceed the
[10:42] speed limit here
[10:44] . I can also adjust the whole thing
[10:45] freely. If I want,
[10:47] I can switch to other driving modes
[10:49] , e.g. Sport. Now it goes
[10:51] slightly uphill and I pedal again
[10:53] . Yes, the whole thing moves along just as quickly
[10:55] , but the accelerator pedal characteristic is a
[10:57] bit sharper, right? And
[10:59] the car would now be a bit
[11:01] sportier. The whole thing
[11:03] also works in My Drive, there I can
[11:04] set the device or Eco, for example, which
[11:07] then reduces the throttle response a bit
[11:09] , right? My favorite mode was
[11:11] actually normal. This simply fits
[11:13] best with this comfortable car.
[11:16] So it's actually really nimble,
[11:18] despite the huge weight the
[11:20] car is carrying around and the mere
[11:23] 307 hp. Especially with electric vehicles,
[11:26] the power range is shifted a bit
[11:27] upwards, and
[11:29] on paper I didn't think that was all that much for the
[11:30] car, but it really does drive
[11:32] very well. Um, we also have
[11:34] recuperation here, which I can
[11:36] adjust in various ways, for example with the
[11:38] steering wheel shift paddles. I'm going to go
[11:40] to zero here and the car would
[11:42] now roll to a complete stop. I've now
[11:43] taken my foot off the accelerator,
[11:45] so there's almost no recuperation, so to speak. Then I can
[11:47] go back to level 1, a
[11:49] little bit stronger, level 2, even
[11:52] stronger, and level 3,
[11:54] a little bit more. I have
[11:55] a car behind me right now, so I'm not going to make it
[11:56] so harsh for you. But what
[11:58] I really like is
[12:01] riding the One Paddle. Hyundai calls it
[12:02] iPadle and that's what's being displayed to me now
[12:04] . Now I have the
[12:05] option to ride with just one pedal
[12:08] . In other words, I can use the brakes very little, for example in the
[12:09] city or in general,
[12:12] and can
[12:15] only steer the car with the accelerator. If
[12:17] I take my foot off the accelerator, the car decelerates
[12:18] quite sharply and then comes to a standstill at 0
[12:20] km/h. I think that's a
[12:23] very interesting thing, a very good
[12:24] thing. I think it belongs in every
[12:27] electric car. You will notice that the speed
[12:29] limit is now 50 km/h. I just need to
[12:31] ease off the gas a little. The car
[12:33] immediately reaches the speed
[12:34] I am allowed to drive here. So, that's
[12:36] really fun. But in principle,
[12:38] this doesn't mean you'll use
[12:39] less electricity. So, if you
[12:41] were to coast for a long time, for example, you would
[12:43] probably use as little electricity
[12:44] as I do, where my car
[12:46] brakes earlier and I have to accelerate
[12:48] earlier, right? Well, that's
[12:50] more of a convenience thing, I think.
[12:52] But I think it's very good.
[12:54] Despite this, the controllability of the
[12:56] brakes is completely fine, I think. Many
[12:59] electric cars are unable to
[13:00] provide good braking control when
[13:02] using recuperation. And
[13:04] then you notice a big difference
[13:05] between the recuperation under a
[13:07] normal foot brake. That is
[13:09] actually not the case here.
[13:10] I really like that. Right now, for example, I'm
[13:12] approaching the roundabout, I'm only
[13:14] slightly taking my foot off the gas, and the car is slowing down,
[13:15] so that's really a lot of fun.
[13:18] Of course, the Ionic 9 also has a
[13:20] pedestrian warning system, because the car
[13:22] itself doesn't make any noise
[13:24] . And I've recorded what it sounds like here
[13:27] for you.
[13:52] So I'm pleasantly surprised by the
[13:55] large SUV and how dynamic a car like that
[13:57] can be when you drive such a large
[13:59] car around. Big could also
[14:03] mean a lot of consumption.
[14:05] But we still have a very large
[14:07] battery here. I was always
[14:09] talking about 110 kowatt hours earlier. But that is
[14:11] the gross figure. The net power is 106
[14:14] kilowatts, but that's still
[14:15] perfectly adequate and provides a
[14:20] very respectable
[14:22] range, even in a large SUV like the one I have here.
[14:24] According to the factory or according to WLTP,
[14:27] Hyundai states 20.6 cowatt hours as the average
[14:31] consumption for the car. I have
[14:33] not reached that point yet, I must say. I
[14:35] 'm currently at 22 KB per 100 km. But
[14:40] I think it's perfectly fine for the
[14:41] weight of the car and the frontal area. The
[14:44] CW value is the good thing, but the frontal area
[14:45] is still large, I think that's
[14:47] perfectly fine. Um, I'm
[14:50] down to 219 right now too. I haven't
[14:52] driven that much yet. Mine
[14:54] currently has 100 km on it. I will be
[14:56] driving the car a lot more and will
[14:58] now show you what my
[15:00] average fuel consumption was in the end.
[15:02] Um, my driving habits will
[15:05] mostly be on country roads,
[15:07] like this or a maximum of 120
[15:09] km/h. Um, less often in the city
[15:12] actually and I think that's a
[15:13] good thing. Sure, if you
[15:15] drive on the highway, you'll probably have 25
[15:17] customers plus, but even then you'll
[15:19] still have a range of a good 400
[15:21] km, and that's quite a lot for a car like this
[15:23] . I'm currently
[15:25] at 80%, for example. The car shows me
[15:27] 439 km and here at least 267
[15:32] km. So, if I really give it power
[15:34] or step on the gas, I can go
[15:37] really far with the car and
[15:39] it charges quickly thanks to the
[15:41] 800-volt technology. I can now
[15:43] put this into perspective with other
[15:45] large electric vehicles I
[15:46] have tested. For example, relatively
[15:49] recently the ID was in the long version.
[15:51] With that I got about 28 kowattunde
[15:53] per 100 km. And the Audi Q8 is also a
[15:57] large SUV, not as big on the inside as the
[15:59] Ionic 9, but pretty close on the
[16:03] outside, and with it I got just under 28
[16:05] kWh, no, nonsense, just under 30
[16:07] kWh. Um,
[16:10] both of those were at slightly colder
[16:12] temperatures. The IDBS was in November
[16:15] and the Audi was, I think, in February
[16:18] or March. Well, it was still
[16:20] relatively fresh back then. I'm now
[16:22] at the roundabout here, what do I have
[16:24] right now? 20° should be close, right? 25
[16:26] shows me. OK. Um,
[16:28] actually drove quite warm. This
[16:31] is probably a bit better
[16:33] for the car. The car
[16:35] even comes with a heat pump as standard
[16:37] . It also ensures
[16:39] efficient heating during
[16:40] winter temperatures. The entry into the
[16:43] Ionic 9 is high with a minimum seat height
[16:46] of 74 cm. The front seats are
[16:50] always electrically adjustable in all directions
[16:53] . The steering wheel from the
[16:55] middle variant onwards is also
[16:58] electric. Lumbar supports that can be electrically adjusted in two ways
[17:00] are
[17:02] standard, while the driver can choose from four
[17:05] different
[17:07] massage programs. This
[17:10] always benefits from a memory function. The
[17:12] relaxation function and seat ventilation are
[17:15] also included from the middle trim level
[17:18] . Even the side bolsters can be
[17:20] adjusted in width. This makes
[17:23] it an excellent seat in the large
[17:25] electric SUV. The base comes with a
[17:28] fabric leather combination.
[17:30] Leather is again present from the middle
[17:32] line onwards. Our Unique even comes
[17:35] with napper leather. There are
[17:37] different color variations. We
[17:40] chose subtle black. The
[17:42] height adjustment of the front belts
[17:44] and the deactivation of the
[17:46] passenger airbag are a matter of course.
[17:48] Unfortunately, ISOFIX is missing on the
[17:50] passenger seat. Visibility
[17:53] suffers somewhat from the rising
[17:55] window line and the headrests that cannot be fully
[17:57] retracted. Therefore, it
[17:59] is advisable to take a closer look at
[18:01] the rear or in the mirrors.
[18:04] Welcome to the large Hyundai
[18:06] SUV, the largest currently available: the
[18:09] Ionic 9. As I said, you can
[18:11] always call it the Ionic 9.
[18:14] First, I'll tell you what different
[18:15] versions of the car there are, then I'll
[18:17] come to the open interior and
[18:19] show you how it works. First there is the
[18:21] basic version, which is called Ionic 9,
[18:24] then the Technik, yes, with Quh at the back and
[18:26] the Unique. We also have Quh in the back and
[18:28] the Unique with us today. The
[18:30] best and also most expensive option,
[18:32] one could say. We start on the left
[18:34] side, where we have the four electric windows in the extension of
[18:36] the arm line
[18:38] . All have
[18:39] an auto function. Behind it we have
[18:41] the electric child lock,
[18:42] for example, and in front of it there is the electric
[18:45] mirror adjustment. The mirrors are
[18:46] standard with electrical adjustment and can also be
[18:50] folded. There are also digital
[18:52] mirrors, as already mentioned outside,
[18:54] but these are only optional for the Unique.
[18:57] Um, then there is the
[18:59] door opener up here, round in shape.
[19:02] In front of it there is the
[19:05] seat adjustment for the narrowness of the
[19:09] sidecar, but underneath there is also
[19:11] the memory function in two
[19:13] different memory locations. Then there's
[19:17] a little keyboard here just above my left knee.
[19:20] Then we have the
[19:21] option to open the tailgate,
[19:23] which you press twice, for example for
[19:26] Frank. Then we have the
[19:28] hold button for the trunk for the
[19:29] electric one. Then
[19:32] the ESP is switched off and the automatic
[19:34] parking brake is activated. This is
[19:35] of course also standard with the auto-collection function
[19:38] . The electric tailgate
[19:39] is also standard. We
[19:42] come to steering. This is
[19:44] leather-covered as standard. Yes, well, it's
[19:47] standard for such a big
[19:48] car. The multifunction buttons are also
[19:50] always there, as are the paddle shifters
[19:52] with which you can
[19:54] adjust the recuperation levels
[19:56] . The heated
[19:58] steering wheel is also included as standard
[20:00] . Well, you could say that the
[20:01] standard equipment is very well equipped
[20:04] . In the middle there are
[20:06] these illuminated pixels, also very
[20:08] interesting, very charming, I think,
[20:09] right? This is also what distinguishes the Hyundai Ionic
[20:12] models.
[20:13] Um, and the steering wheel is also
[20:15] electrically adjustable, but that only comes as
[20:18] standard in the Technology variant and above. We
[20:20] have this with us. Which keys do we
[20:22] always have on? On the left side
[20:24] we have the buttons for the
[20:27] cruise control system and the ACC system,
[20:30] i.e. the distance control, as well as the
[20:32] highway assistant, are already very well
[20:34] integrated. I'll show you how it works
[20:35] later. On the right-hand
[20:37] side there are the buttons for
[20:39] the digital instrument cluster, for example. But
[20:41] also for the volume control
[20:43] with this little
[20:44] roller, which I always find quite
[20:45] charming. Here on the left we also have
[20:46] a small roller. Um, exactly. Um, to
[20:51] show you what's behind the wheel, I'd first like to show you the
[20:52] key. This makes things
[20:53] a little better. Um, because
[20:55] we have the Hyundai key here
[20:57] , which you already know. This
[20:59] is typical of the Hyundai logo here.
[21:01] For example, we have open, close and also
[21:03] the hold function for the automatic
[21:05] parking assistant. We have that here too
[21:07] . You can
[21:09] then control the car remotely. For example, if you get
[21:10] parked, you can just
[21:11] drive straight out. This can
[21:13] be very useful. I
[21:15] already showed you this at Tson. The
[21:16] whip is also available with it. The
[21:19] Smart Key, the Smartkey function is
[21:21] standard. You approach the car
[21:23] with the key in your pocket,
[21:24] e.g. The Turkish approach automatically engages
[21:27] and you can unlock the car. To
[21:29] start the vehicle you have
[21:30] a start button in here and this
[21:31] start button is hidden here on the
[21:33] gearbox lever. It's plugged into
[21:35] the Läksule here and you always have
[21:37] start/stop on it. Press it up once and
[21:40] then the ignition or
[21:42] the power would be activated. Um, to start
[21:44] I would have to apply the brake once
[21:45] , right? That's quite typical. Um,
[21:47] I'll show you again how
[21:49] I can operate the gearbox here,
[21:50] because I could drive off now if
[21:51] I just step on the brake, for example, and
[21:53] turn this gear lever forward. D
[21:55] I'm in the, well, I'm going to start,
[21:57] stop. Exactly. I have this sound
[21:59] too and then if I move it forward,
[22:01] I'm in position D, i.e. in
[22:03] drive. If I go to the back,
[22:05] very easily, if I'm in neutral, for example
[22:07] for the car wash, but
[22:09] please please choose a width and then
[22:11] we can go right to the back.
[22:12] We have reverse gear and
[22:14] we also have a number of parking assistance features as
[22:16] standard in the vehicle,
[22:20] for example the front and rear parking
[22:22] assistance and the camera is also
[22:23] standard. The lateral parking aid,
[22:26] for example, the park emergency brake assistant, i.e.
[22:29] a maneuvering brake aid, for example, and also
[22:33] the 360° camera that we have here on
[22:35] the right-hand side, right, where
[22:37] you
[22:40] can also turn the car around, right? You
[22:41] already know some of this from my tests. There
[22:43] you can see exactly how far it says
[22:44] here and so on. Well, that
[22:46] can be really helpful,
[22:48] especially with a big car,
[22:49] right? Um, there's a larger
[22:53] version of this,
[22:55] for example, the remote control I just
[22:57] showed you with the key, so you
[23:00] can drive the car forwards and backwards. This will be standard from the technology onwards
[23:02] , i.e. from the second
[23:03] variant onwards. Well, otherwise I can
[23:05] go back to P on the gearbox, like the
[23:07] lever on the side here, and then
[23:09] I automatically activate the parking brake
[23:10] and then, well, park the car
[23:13] . Of course, you
[23:15] also get two more levers with the Ionic
[23:17] 9. For example, you've done a really nice job with the turn signal lever here
[23:20] .
[23:22] This silver Ran, for example, looks qualitatively.
[23:25] The light sensor is standard and
[23:27] the rain sensor on the wiper lever on the
[23:29] right side is also included in the series
[23:32] . In front of me we always have
[23:34] a 12.3-inch digital
[23:37] instrument cluster. There are
[23:39] different display modes that you can
[23:41] set using the farm modes, for example,
[23:44] but also separately in the combo in the
[23:46] infotainment system accordingly.
[23:48] I'll give you a quick rundown here.
[23:50] For example, we have sports. We have
[23:52] a somewhat more sporty view.
[23:54] We have MyDrive included, which you can
[23:55] configure separately. Eco or
[23:57] normal. You can also change the view
[23:59] of the raw instruments. This is
[24:01] now the classic view. But you can
[24:03] also get a more modern or even
[24:05] simpler view, then you
[24:07] always have digital speed
[24:09] included. Um, that's about the
[24:11] external elements. In the middle there
[24:13] is an on-board computer. I control it
[24:15] now, for example, with the right side, with
[24:18] the left side, so with the
[24:20] right roller on the left
[24:22] steering wheel, for example. Here we can
[24:25] scroll, tire pressure,
[24:27] drive force distribution and so on,
[24:29] also the on-board computer, right? A very important
[24:32] function, I also find the range helper
[24:33] very interesting. You have
[24:35] a minimum range of 328 km,
[24:38] for example, when driving on the motorway, or a
[24:40] maximum of 702 when driving through the
[24:41] city - the car always calculates this for you -
[24:43] and the average would be
[24:44] 535, which is what it's showing now, which is more
[24:47] than that. But you can also
[24:49] display different things with this
[24:50] little tab up here. Then there is
[24:52] a small compass or
[24:53] the Navifile, for example,
[24:56] or there is an assistant graphic
[24:58] there. What the car still doesn't have is
[25:01] the map from the
[25:03] navigation system, and I think that's a
[25:04] shame. Especially with the large car we have here,
[25:06] the Elekant, it would be a very
[25:08] nice extra if the
[25:09] navigation map could be seen in a nice, large format
[25:11] . Well, some say it's right
[25:13] next to it in the Curve Display
[25:15] , right? But well, I
[25:16] always find it quite practical to have it in front of me. From the
[25:18] technology variant onwards you also have
[25:20] the head-up display as standard. This is
[25:23] a display embedded in the cockpit,
[25:25] which then projects directly onto the
[25:27] windscreen. You can
[25:29] display various things there, e.g. information
[25:31] from the driver assistance systems, navigation
[25:33] instructions, but of course also very
[25:34] importantly, I find the speed driven
[25:36] very helpful. That's why
[25:38] I like to keep the classic view here, for example,
[25:39] and
[25:41] then the digital speed is
[25:43] shown in the head-up display. The second part of this curved
[25:46] screen, which of course consists of two displays,
[25:47] is tilted a little towards me
[25:49] , which I really like and
[25:51] we already know it from various
[25:52] vehicles, the new Tson Facelift, the
[25:55] Kona, for example, you've already
[25:57] seen a lot of it in my test. Ionic 9 is also
[25:59] housed here in the same way. Um, it's
[26:02] also 12.3 inches big, has a
[26:04] navigation system as standard and
[26:06] smartphone connectivity that
[26:08] works wirelessly via Apple CarPlay and
[26:10] Android Auto. Uh, in addition, there are
[26:12] also seven speakers and the
[26:14] overth updates for the system, which are
[26:16] standard. Um, let's just start
[26:19] with the view. Here we have
[26:20] this standard view again, where we
[26:22] have various widgets. I'm going to hold
[26:24] down here for a long time, so you can
[26:25] move it around as
[26:27] you like, for example, um, and here are some
[26:30] other things in this
[26:33] view. But we
[26:35] also have a few physical
[26:38] buttons on the car. Down here, for example, there's a
[26:39] control knob for the audio system.
[26:42] The home view always includes the map
[26:44] of the narrative system, which you can
[26:45] access directly from here. There is a
[26:48] search function where we
[26:51] can search for various things, contacts, media, but also navigation destinations. The
[26:53] media key, Seack, Favorite and Setup.
[26:56] Just like here, for example, scrolling through
[26:59] the system, if we don't
[27:00] want to operate it by touch at first, we can also do that with
[27:02] this right rotary switch. So very, very
[27:04] sensibly placed. Let's look at
[27:06] all of this one by one. Uh,
[27:08] for example, we have the card here, we
[27:11] have an electric vehicle here.
[27:12] That's why it's very interesting to
[27:13] know how the whole thing works
[27:15] with the charging planning. Let's take a look
[27:17] now. I'll also test
[27:18] the voice control with it.
[27:22] Navigate me to the road
[27:24] to Munich.
[27:27] Would you like to start the route guidance to this
[27:29] location?
[27:31] Yes.
[27:34] Route guidance is started.
[27:37] After 80 m, turn left at the end of the street
[27:40] . That's
[27:41] exactly what it looks like. So the planning was
[27:43] done well. Let's take a look at
[27:46] when and how he
[27:48] wants to charge. You can see, for example, that it starts down here
[27:51] . We would stop for a gas station
[27:53] here in 235 km and then
[27:55] again at Lego in 447 km and then arrive at our
[27:58] destination in Munich with 30% battery remaining
[28:01] . Um, here you can
[28:03] also display the remaining time or the
[28:06] arrival time. I find it very practical.
[28:07] Here you can see the maps again, of
[28:08] course also nicely with the
[28:09] satellite image, for example, where you then have to
[28:11] load, it would be twice here
[28:13] to Munich and the nice thing is, once 16
[28:16] minutes, once 14 minutes, so
[28:17] really very quick. The car can
[28:19] also charge very quickly thanks to the 800-volt system
[28:21] . I think it's a cool
[28:22] story that the car
[28:24] incorporates this well, right? Uh, that's
[28:26] just what's expected in an
[28:27] electric vehicle these days. So, great. Understood. That
[28:30] 's the navigation system again,
[28:32] right? You can also
[28:33] see different ways in which the map
[28:35] should look, for example. And on
[28:37] the right-hand side in the various
[28:38] elements you always have this sidebar,
[28:40] which you can also hide. There
[28:42] you can view various things
[28:43] , such as EV Rodenplaner,
[28:45] weather and backseat conversation.
[28:49] Yes, it has a loud, uh,
[28:50] a voice amplification for
[28:53] the backbenchers, for example. And you can hear it
[28:55] , it sounds a bit like a
[28:57] telephone. Quite interesting, is
[28:59] n't it? I always find it a bit
[29:00] unnatural, don't you? But with a large
[29:02] car, it can be very useful if,
[29:03] for example, I, as the driver,
[29:05] want to say something to someone in the third row of seats. Exactly. There are
[29:08] a lot of functions,
[29:09] they're really, um, the
[29:11] charging station, for example, is also quite practical,
[29:13] right? Oh, also a very
[29:15] interesting system here, where you
[29:19] have the power consumption of different elements. So
[29:20] the whole thing was very, very comprehensive. Okay, we're
[29:23] going back into the, uh, home. Um, we
[29:25] have radiomien here. Of course,
[29:27] you already know that. You can
[29:29] create favorites. But you can also
[29:30] just go in Dibfra, right? And here
[29:32] also for the switch in the
[29:33] side. You can already see Bos Center Point.
[29:36] We have the BOS sound system, which has
[29:38] more speakers, including a
[29:40] surround system. Bose Centerp, as I
[29:43] said, you can see a
[29:45] center speaker up here and also a
[29:48] subwoofer and an ANC system, i.e.
[29:51] active noise cancellation. You know this
[29:53] from your wireless headphones
[29:55] , for example, which
[29:58] filter out ambient noise and then give you a
[30:00] better sound experience, right? So also
[30:01] very interesting, a better
[30:03] listening experience you could say. Um, EV, there
[30:06] are various
[30:07] electric functions, you've
[30:08] just seen that.
[30:09] I find the energy consumption chart
[30:10] very interesting, what is using what at any given moment
[30:12] , right? Yes, I'm also standing
[30:13] right now with the vehicle running, which always
[30:16] distorts your consumption a bit. It's
[30:17] just rising because I'm just
[30:18] standing here and letting the car run.
[30:21] Um, range history,
[30:23] battery usage statistics and so on,
[30:26] you can see different charging stations
[30:27] here. Missing to Load
[30:30] function e.g. zisb or
[30:32] start the conditioning here. This can
[30:34] also be done manually here. I find it a very
[30:35] interesting thing. Stand mode, for example,
[30:38] I could theoretically put the battery
[30:41] into stand mode here.
[30:42] Yes, exactly. You can see
[30:44] a different view right here in front of me, right? Uh,
[30:46] that's very, very interesting. Uh,
[30:49] yeah, I'll deactivate it. Okay, now
[30:52] the car has turned off. Yes, so
[30:54] much for startup mode. Very interesting,
[30:56] but you can do that, right? So for
[30:57] camping or something like that this can
[30:59] be an interesting function. Exactly. Plug and Charge
[31:01] also supports intelligent
[31:03] recuperation, even using a map, so it's
[31:05] very interesting.
[31:07] What the car offers here is very diverse. My
[31:09] phone is currently connected to
[31:12] my iPhone via Apple CarPlay,
[31:14] at least in theory.
[31:16] But he just kicked out
[31:18] apparently. I don't know why either.
[31:19] Good. Phone production, as I said,
[31:21] CarPlay would be included for me. Exactly,
[31:23] there it is. is also very nice on the
[31:25] big screen, but you can
[31:26] imagine it like this. You can take voice notes
[31:28] , which I find very interesting.
[31:30] 128 MW, but enough for that. We have
[31:33] seat adjustment, we'll come to
[31:34] that now. The car had a lot of
[31:36] heating and ventilation functions,
[31:39] um, folding, raising also via the
[31:41] system, for example here. So very interesting.
[31:44] Then there is the
[31:45] car wash mode, the setting, which
[31:47] is very, very in-depth, we have
[31:50] various vehicle settings for
[31:51] the driving assistance, e.g. the engine sound.
[31:54] We have a sound in the car that
[31:56] can be played, right?
[31:58] We can do that through it too. Here on the
[31:59] left side you can still see the individual
[32:01] settings for the light, including
[32:03] the ambient lighting. You'll see
[32:04] lighting patterns and
[32:06] so on again later. So, everything is very, very
[32:08] profound. If I were to show you all of this
[32:09] , it would go beyond the scope
[32:11] . That's why
[32:13] another test is looking at it, right? And here
[32:15] you also have the
[32:16] opportunity to change the theme of such a
[32:17] combination instrument in a classic, modern
[32:19] way, as I already said
[32:20] . I find this to be
[32:22] very, very profound. What
[32:24] else do we have with us? On the weather page there is
[32:26] also a
[32:28] weather forecast and what the weather is supposed to be like
[32:30] today, for example. We then have a
[32:33] calendar, sports results,
[32:34] wallet mode if you want to drop off your car at the park
[32:36] , in-car payment
[32:38] option for charging, e.g.
[32:40] vehicle diagnostic notifications and
[32:42] also an online manual. It's just
[32:44] very comprehensive. Then there is
[32:46] another bar here that you
[32:47] can pull down. Exactly. Where you then
[32:51] have various quick access options, such as the rear seat conversation, for example,
[32:54] or navigation instructions, how loud
[32:55] everything should be, how bright the
[32:57] display should be, because that's all done
[32:58] via that. There are various
[33:00] profile settings that you
[33:01] can make. If it were your car,
[33:03] you could include your profile.
[33:05] On the right side there is a clock, so
[33:06] the system is very, very comprehensive. I
[33:08] like it very much. We also have a
[33:10] new voice control system, a new AI
[33:13] voice assistant, that belongs here
[33:14] and we can
[33:16] test it again right now.
[33:19] When was Albert Einstein born?
[33:24] Albert Einstein was born on March 14, 1879
[33:28] .
[33:33] Tell me a joke.
[33:38] What does a cannibal order in a
[33:39] restaurant? The waiter.
[33:43] Open the driver's window.
[33:47] The window on the driver's side
[33:49] opens.
[33:52] So, you can see from these
[33:53] examples. Of course, I can also
[33:55] use it to control the air conditioning or the
[33:56] seat heating. Uh, navigation you
[33:59] already saw earlier. So it is now a good
[34:00] savings assistant. He understands
[34:01] a lot. I don't know if you want to hear jokes,
[34:04] but
[34:05] for me it's always a bit of an
[34:07] effect, is it good speech control
[34:09] or something that could be improved, and in
[34:10] this case I would describe it as good.
[34:13] After the infotainment system we come
[34:15] to the large block of buttons that we
[34:17] have down here. Above you have
[34:19] already seen the
[34:20] infotainment buttons. In the middle there is
[34:22] also the warming system as a
[34:24] physical button. Below we have
[34:26] the climate control. The Ionic 9 comes
[34:29] standard with three-zone
[34:31] automatic climate control. So there is also
[34:32] a separate climate zone at the back. We can control them
[34:35] partly with these rotary
[34:38] elements here, but also with
[34:40] a display that
[34:41] has various touch elements down here. For example,
[34:44] you can also control the seat heating
[34:45] or the seat climate control via it.
[34:48] And interestingly, both are
[34:52] standard from the technical point of view and
[34:54] the base even includes
[34:55] seat heating, right? So seat ventilation from
[34:57] the technology, seat heating already in the
[34:59] base. Then we also have the
[35:00] steering wheel heating, for example, for steering here with
[35:02] two different settings and
[35:04] also the windshield, rear window and so
[35:06] on. Everything goes through it, I find it
[35:08] very practical. There are only touch buttons,
[35:10] but at least there are dials
[35:12] for the temperature. I find that
[35:13] quite practical in that respect. What I did
[35:15] n't find was a heated
[35:18] windshield. Apparently the car does
[35:19] n't have that. I find it
[35:21] a bit of a shame here and there, but of course,
[35:23] you can simply
[35:24] pre-condition the car and you don't need a
[35:26] heated windshield anymore. There are
[35:28] a few more buttons here at the
[35:29] level of my right knee. Actually,
[35:31] they are located here in the center armrest
[35:33] . For example, there is the
[35:34] driving mode switch, where you
[35:36] can decide on drive and terrain. So
[35:38] there's the snow mat and sand and
[35:39] then the drive and the things that I've
[35:41] just shown you. Then you can
[35:42] activate and deactivate the autohot function here
[35:44] . The work assistance
[35:46] as well and then we have
[35:47] the cameras here again, for example, which we
[35:49] can activate with a button. Um, and
[35:52] exactly, you can also hold it down to
[35:55] activate the buttons, right?
[35:57] You could do that too, right? Select parking direction
[35:58] . Very interesting. And next to that
[36:00] we also have the
[36:01] one-work help, which we can activate and
[36:03] deactivate. And there is also
[36:06] ambient lighting in the vehicle,
[36:08] which is standard from the middle
[36:09] variant technology. For example, it is
[36:12] located here below this element
[36:14] in the cockpit or here in the
[36:16] door access or in the
[36:19] storage areas below. I think it's quite nice.
[36:20] I would like to show you again what
[36:21] it looks like in the dark.
[36:24] We take a look at the workmanship and
[36:26] storage options in the Ionic 9 from
[36:28] Hyundai. And we have an SUV
[36:31] with a luxury FLIR, you could say.
[36:33] That's why there are also foamed
[36:35] materials on the door panel. Underneath
[36:37] this silver strip there is
[36:38] a beautiful decorative element, but also a
[36:41] lot of artificial leather, which is nice and soft
[36:43] . Here below, then
[36:46] foamed again at the top. Here you can see that
[36:48] and a bit of
[36:49] hard plastic below. Then here again
[36:50] the padding is made nice and soft, also
[36:52] around the element for the window lifters,
[36:54] for example, here below also with
[36:56] artificial leather. Then there's
[36:59] this hard surface down here
[37:01] and then there's a silver
[37:03] bar here, but
[37:04] we also have the Bose system in here, right? The
[37:06] cockpit below is also made of hard plastic,
[37:08] then there is this silver strip here.
[37:12] I'm not really a fan of that,
[37:13] I have to say. It's
[37:16] just a plastic strip, right? It could have been
[37:22] done a little nicer, maybe not exactly, but with a bit of the same structure. Um, because it's
[37:25] just a silver bar. On top there are
[37:27] nice ones with
[37:29] artificial leather or foamed
[37:31] materials here. And back here
[37:35] there's hard plastic, right? So not
[37:37] consistently high quality, but well
[37:40] made and I think still
[37:43] appropriate for the vehicle class. There are
[37:45] various design elements in the
[37:46] interior. We've
[37:47] kept everything in silver here, for example here
[37:50] in the middle too, and you can
[37:52] see Calligraphy here. It's a
[37:53] bit difficult with the light right now, is
[37:55] n't it? Um, we also have a nice
[37:57] interesting element there. It looks a
[37:58] bit like Frozen, a bit
[38:00] like ice crystals and so on. Very
[38:02] interesting. And it says calligraphy
[38:04] . So especially with the Unique
[38:06] version, this is something
[38:07] special. Uh, exactly. We'll
[38:09] just start with the storage, maybe with
[38:10] the other extras. For example, we have to
[38:12] access a door. That's what I was
[38:14] looking for first. It's here,
[38:15] behind the armrest, so to speak. At the bottom
[38:18] we have a compartment for putting a drink
[38:20] , for example, it has a
[38:24] frosted glass or
[38:25] frosted plastic lining.
[38:27] I don't think it's quite as chic here. It looks a
[38:28] bit like a refrigerator compartment,
[38:29] but yes, it's certainly sufficient. There's
[38:32] still room for a small power pack here
[38:33] . Unfortunately, the space back here is
[38:35] wasted. There is no
[38:36] additional storage space.
[38:39] No glove compartment for the driver down here either. This
[38:40] is where the fuse is located and,
[38:41] interestingly, the
[38:43] opening for the Frank
[38:45] Dachtech er, why do I have to
[38:47] remove the panel here? But up here
[38:48] we have the electrical function, so
[38:49] that's also good, of course. uh
[38:52] no more storage space up above, then there's
[38:54] something interesting down here. First of all,
[38:56] we have three USB-C
[38:59] options here. Once for the
[39:01] audio system interface and
[39:03] twice for charging with a total output of 100 watts
[39:05] , which is also quite
[39:06] decent. On the right side, you can
[39:08] see the 12-volt option,
[39:10] which the Ionic 9 also has. And here you can see
[39:12] the UVC button. What is that? UVC
[39:15] is a compartment that is located down here
[39:18] . You can put a cell phone in there, for example,
[39:20] and it will then be
[39:23] cleaned. So very interesting, right?
[39:25] A few UV rays, so to speak. Very
[39:27] interesting. Uh, that's included too,
[39:30] and it's only
[39:33] standard on the Unique, right? There's
[39:35] another compartment here, also nicely
[39:37] lined with non-slip material. But there is
[39:38] no smartphone charging area there,
[39:40] it is located up here.
[39:43] It even comes as standard in the
[39:46] vehicle. For
[39:49] example, there's
[39:50] my smartphone here where I can put it
[39:52] and charge it wirelessly, for example.
[39:54] Even my iPhone did that. Exactly, those are my
[39:57] few notes about the vehicle.
[39:59] Everything is almost live, you could say.
[40:01] Fits in here well. I have an iPhone 15
[40:03] Pro Max, right? So I
[40:04] still have enough space underneath, for example, and the
[40:06] iPhone LER actually works reliably,
[40:08] even though the whole thing isn't cooled.
[40:10] I find that a bit of a shame. It's
[40:11] a bit raised, so a
[40:13] little air gets to the device, but it
[40:14] 's not actively cooled. Um, exactly. And
[40:17] as far as I know, that's
[40:20] also standard. Next comes the
[40:22] armrest. First of all, quite interesting.
[40:24] We can open this one. This
[40:26] also works from behind. Show again later
[40:28] and then drop a lot here. For
[40:30] example, there's a small
[40:31] plastic part here that you can take out
[40:33] and then it goes way down
[40:35] , right? Where we also
[40:36] have a compartment that we
[40:38] can pull out at the back, for example, right? But that will come
[40:40] back in. And although we ca
[40:43] n't move
[40:44] the armrest up here lengthwise, we
[40:46] can move the entire element, this entire
[40:48] element here.
[40:50] We have a handle on the front here and
[40:52] you can then move it backwards
[40:54] or forwards, for example,
[40:56] and you'll notice how nicely it works,
[40:57] how well it runs on these rails
[40:59] . Very coolly done. Easy
[41:02] to move manually, right? Then
[41:04] you can push it back
[41:05] if you want or something, right? Well, that
[41:07] 's very practical and you can
[41:11] adjust the armrest to suit you. Uh, exactly, we
[41:13] also have a glove compartment
[41:15] . Above it there is also
[41:16] a small storage area, which
[41:17] is also lined with a non-slip surface. And then
[41:19] here, for example, with the small handle here
[41:21] we can open the glove compartment
[41:22] . Not much fits in there, it
[41:24] 's quite small. But it is also primarily
[41:25] intended for gloves. It's
[41:27] actually illuminated, but otherwise it's
[41:29] just made of hard plastic, right? Also
[41:31] good in disguise. Uh,
[41:34] we don't have anything on the right side, but the
[41:37] door panel on the right side is the same
[41:38] as the left side. And you can see
[41:40] something special here in the car. One thing
[41:42] my car has is the panoramic roof.
[41:45] This is optional for all lines. The
[41:46] nice thing is, we can even open it.
[41:48] This is no
[41:50] longer necessarily the case with electric vehicles today. But you can
[41:52] also see on my car, if you
[41:54] look here, we have an Alcantara
[41:56] headliner and that's only the case with the Unique
[41:58] . Well, that's quite elegant, by
[42:00] the way, the A-pillar is also
[42:02] framed there, for example. We
[42:04] also have the sun visor for the right-hand
[42:06] side with the small vanity mirror and
[42:09] not the semi-automatic
[42:10] light function, but a properly
[42:12] automatic light function, as it should be
[42:14] . The undercarriage has safety handles on the three
[42:18] passenger seats in row 1 for one
[42:20] passenger seat and in row 2 for
[42:22] both outer seats. The
[42:24] driver doesn't have one and unfortunately the third row doesn't have
[42:26] one either. In the middle there is
[42:28] another element where I
[42:29] could open the sunroof, for example, or
[42:32] move a blackout blind forward. That works back there too. Um,
[42:35] otherwise you can also
[42:36] control the lights for the entire
[42:38] vehicle, for example, or control the
[42:40] lights at the back, for example, and
[42:43] turn the lights off so that they do
[42:45] n't turn on when the doors open,
[42:46] and you can control the reading light
[42:47] separately with a
[42:49] small touch function above it. You
[42:51] have to hit it exactly,
[42:52] but you get used to it. There is
[42:55] a special feature in the middle
[42:56] , because we have an
[42:58] automatically dimming interior mirror,
[43:00] which comes as standard. In our case,
[43:03] however, we also have a kind of
[43:04] computer mirror, because we
[43:06] once, I came and took a quick look at the
[43:08] car again.
[43:10] Um, because here you can see the image from
[43:12] the camera's interior mirror.
[43:15] You can do it like this once, and then
[43:16] you have a normal rearview mirror. No,
[43:18] as far as I can see, but you can
[43:19] do it like this too. Do you have this
[43:21] computer function here,
[43:22] i.e. the camera that is located at the back of the
[43:24] vehicle? Can be very practical
[43:25] , especially when there are a lot of people in the
[43:27] car, for example, as you can't see
[43:28] anything back there anyway. I think the camera always sees something, which is
[43:30] nice. So the picture is always
[43:31] a bit limited, I think,
[43:32] right? This could be optimized a bit
[43:34] , but you can also
[43:35] adjust it here, e.g. via a menu, that's
[43:37] possible there, right? um,
[43:40] adjust the brightness up and down, right? That works.
[43:42] I find that very interesting.
[43:43] And this interior camera mirror is
[43:49] also standard on the Munique. Otherwise, there's also
[43:52] a sun visor for the driver,
[43:53] of course, also with this beautiful
[43:55] Alcantara with a small clip for the
[43:56] vehicle registration document and also the
[43:58] vanity mirror with the automatic
[44:00] lighting up here. And as I said,
[44:02] the A-pillar is also nice. You can see it
[44:04] very well covered with Alcantara. How
[44:06] much does the Hyundai Ionic 9 large SUV cost
[44:09] ? We start at
[44:14] €68,500 for the basic version. The
[44:16] base version has rear-wheel drive, 218
[44:19] hp, and a large 110
[44:22] KB battery, which is always included anyway.
[44:24] Level TP then indicates a range of
[44:26] 620 km for this variant with one
[44:29] battery charge. However, the car does
[44:32] not have a simple basic equipment, but
[44:33] rather a lot. For example, the
[44:35] LED headlights are very regular.
[44:37] We also have the large curved display with
[44:40] the navigation system
[44:41] included as standard. There are heated front and
[44:44] rear seats, as well as
[44:46] an electric tailgate,
[44:48] a rearview camera, and a heat pump
[44:51] for effectively heating the vehicle in
[44:53] winter. The car is also well positioned when it comes to
[44:54] driver assistance systems
[44:56] . For example, you have the
[44:58] ACC system series with the
[44:59] motorway assistant, but also the
[45:02] various mandatory features such as an
[45:04] emergency braking assistant,
[45:05] fatigue detection,
[45:07] traffic sign recognition as well as a
[45:09] lane keeping assistant.
[45:11] The
[45:13] all-wheel drive version we tested,
[45:15] with 307 hp, makes a big difference in price. That gives us a
[45:18] base price of
[45:21] €81,500. However, this means that the
[45:23] car is only available in the technology version
[45:26] and not in the basic version. The
[45:28] all-wheel drive version in the Performance
[45:30] variant with 428 hp is available from
[45:36] €750 and this, in turn, is
[45:38] only available in the best Unique variant. That
[45:41] seems like a hefty price for
[45:43] the large SUV, but we have to
[45:45] put it in perspective with
[45:47] its competitors and only then will we find
[45:49] out whether this is a good
[45:51] offer from Hyundai or just
[45:53] rather expensive. A comparison partner
[45:55] that we have to consult immediately
[45:57] is the Kia EB9 or EV9, if you
[46:00] like, in the exhibition version Air
[46:02] and that is also a large SUV, similar in
[46:04] class to the Ionic 9 from
[46:06] Hyundai. It also has the
[46:09] 218 hp engine, probably the
[46:11] same one that's in the Hyundai
[46:12] . Um, but with the battery in
[46:15] connection with 99.8 customers, so a
[46:17] little smaller. The car has
[46:19] rear-wheel drive and the battery provides
[46:20] a
[46:23] maximum range of 563 km on one battery charge according to WLTP. The
[46:27] car costs at least
[46:31] €66,190. Has the seats with
[46:33] artificial leather ahead of the Hyundai, but no
[46:36] heat pump as standard, for example. And the Kia is
[46:38] also available with a smaller
[46:40] battery with 76.1 cowatt hours. That would
[46:43] then cost €3,000 less.
[46:45] The Hyundai Ionic 9 can also be compared to large vans
[46:48] , such as the
[46:50] Volkswagen ID.5. It is available in the
[46:52] long version with a battery with 86
[46:55] cowatt hours. This should
[46:56] provide a range of 487 km and the
[47:00] car has an engine power of 286 hp.
[47:03] The car has rear-wheel drive and a
[47:06] base price of
[47:09] €62,903. However, the car has significantly
[47:11] worse basic equipment than the
[47:13] Hyundai, for example the ACC system, to name just one
[47:16] , is not included in the base
[47:17] . The base car also
[47:19] only has five seats. There is no
[47:21] navigation system, no electric
[47:23] tailgate, and no heat pump in
[47:25] the base model. The seven-seater version of the
[47:27] IDbass would be optional and costs an
[47:31] extra €1,350. I would also
[47:35] compare the Hyundai Ionic 9 with the Volvo EX90
[47:37] . The Volvo is then available in the
[47:39] basic Core variant with the single engine.
[47:42] It has 279 hp and
[47:44] also rear-wheel drive. The Volvo
[47:47] has a 104 kW-hour battery,
[47:50] which
[47:51] should provide a range of 620 km on one battery charge.
[47:55] But the Volvo also costs at least
[47:59] €83,700. However, the Hyundai has the
[48:01] artificial leather seats in the base and a
[48:03] fixed panoramic roof. But in its
[48:05] base it is only a five-seater. The
[48:07] seven-seater would cost an extra €2,300
[48:10] . Let's return to the Hyundai
[48:12] Ionic 9. It is available with
[48:14] various exterior variants, such as
[48:16] the Technique variant. This is the
[48:18] middle line and has a lot of technology
[48:20] , as the name suggests.
[48:23] For example, we have the Bose Centerpoint
[48:25] speaker system, but also the
[48:27] leather seats with seat ventilation.
[48:29] This also includes the Matrix LED headlights
[48:32] and the digital interior mirror as well
[48:34] as the 360° cameras for parking.
[48:37] The Unique version adds a
[48:39] bit of elegance. Then there's
[48:41] the napper leather, for example, which we also
[48:43] have with us, and also the UVC compartment, which is
[48:45] located at the bottom, where you
[48:47] can put your devices or jewelry, for
[48:49] example, and the calligraphy
[48:52] design elements on the outside, but also on the inside
[48:54] with this design panel, for example. There are
[48:57] a few packages, for example the
[48:59] assistance package. There you have
[49:00] the angle warning system with the
[49:03] monitor, but also the 360° cameras. This
[49:07] is only available for the base. All
[49:09] other variants already have the package as
[49:10] standard. Then there are
[49:13] various packages with the
[49:14] six-seater system. Partly the
[49:16] relax seats, but also the survival
[49:19] package. And I’ll show you what it can do in a
[49:21] moment. There are also a
[49:22] few individual extras, such as the panoramic roof
[49:25] or the digital exterior mirrors.
[49:26] But this only applies to the
[49:28] Unique variant. Let’s briefly talk about my
[49:30] test car. The car here comes from the
[49:32] Döring car dealership in Berlin.
[49:34] Thank you very much for providing the
[49:36] very new Ionic 9 for my test.
[49:39] This is the Unique trim level
[49:41] , the best variant with the
[49:43] 307 hp engine and
[49:45] all-wheel drive. Other features
[49:47] included here include the panoramic
[49:49] glass roof, which can be opened. Um, we
[49:51] have a listed price for this car
[49:54] here of
[49:57] €88,150. This also includes the
[50:00] Celladon Grady paint finish, which is
[50:01] already included in the calculation. But this car
[50:03] is a demonstration car,
[50:05] from August 2025. Uh, the car had
[50:09] only done 500 km when
[50:11] I handed it in, probably a
[50:12] bit more. It is available for
[50:16] €75,990 at Autohaus Döring. Of course, I've
[50:18] also included a link
[50:19] , which you can find below
[50:21] in the description. Before I
[50:23] get into the back for you, because this is what
[50:24] fans of my channel usually know,
[50:26] I'll show you a few more
[50:27] things from this perspective.
[50:30] The car comes with
[50:32] seven seats as standard. Then you have
[50:34] a three-seater bench here in the middle,
[50:36] as you know it. The nice thing about it is that
[50:38] it has seat heating and
[50:40] seat ventilation as standard. This bench
[50:42] can be moved and its incline can also be
[50:44] adjusted, making it very
[50:45] variable. In our case, we have a
[50:47] different package because there are two
[50:49] different packages. For example, there is the
[50:52] Relax package. You can have
[50:54] similar things on the front seats. Here you can
[50:56] basically extend a support for your lower legs
[50:59] . You can move the seats electrically
[51:01] and use the relax
[51:04] function. We have
[51:06] another package, the Zival package, and
[51:09] that has rotating seats that can be
[51:11] adjusted manually as usual.
[51:13] We have a pole down here
[51:14] , right? You can push it forward here
[51:16] , but also backward. That is
[51:18] quite clear. But you also have
[51:20] a small option down here to turn the seat, so that you can get
[51:26] out, for example. So I can
[51:28] really hop out of the car. Another
[51:30] interesting thing, perhaps
[51:31] for
[51:33] people with limited mobility, is that it's easier to get in
[51:35] or you can turn the seats completely
[51:37] and then it goes on like that
[51:39] . Oh, am I stuck here?
[51:41] No, I just didn't operate the handle
[51:42] . Well, well, I have to do it this way.
[51:46] Then I push it inwards.
[51:48] Apparently it only goes in this
[51:50] direction.
[51:53] Yes, you can't see with four wheels that
[51:54] I'm turning around in the car. That
[51:57] usually only works with larger
[52:01] vehicles, right? Like larger vans
[52:04] or something. I'm going to adjust the
[52:05] seat a little bit here so I
[52:06] can rotate it for you. So, bang. And
[52:09] now I have this
[52:11] function here, which you normally
[52:12] only find in large vans or something like that. That
[52:15] 's basically what I see as my fellow passengers
[52:17] here in the third row of seats. Uh,
[52:19] and I also find it interesting,
[52:22] I thought this function
[52:23] might only be useful for a break
[52:24] . You might
[52:26] not be able to do this if you're
[52:28] driving. But it works. However, the car
[52:30] reports at the front that
[52:32] the side airbag at the rear will be deactivated
[52:34] . But you still have
[52:36] the G on the seat, so you can
[52:38] use it quite comfortably and you
[52:40] can still drive around here if you
[52:41] want. That would be
[52:43] possible. Just like the seating packages in the
[52:46] Hyundai Ionic 9. Getting in and out of the
[52:49] back of the Ionic 9 is really easy. You can
[52:51] rotate the seats of one part.
[52:53] But you can also
[52:54] get in naturally and normally and this works
[52:56] really well thanks to the very large doors. I'm
[52:57] sitting back here in the second
[52:59] row now. As I said, we have the
[53:01] Welpaket here. We have the individual seats
[53:02] with us. So that’s a total of
[53:04] exactly six seats. We won't have
[53:06] the seven seats anymore.
[53:07] You need to know that too. And the driver's seat is
[53:11] adjusted to a height of 1.80 m. I can
[53:12] sit very comfortably there and as you can see
[53:14] , I have plenty of
[53:15] space. I think I can say
[53:16] no, I can
[53:18] go further back now, that's not possible. I'm sitting
[53:19] as far back as I can now, but I
[53:21] still have more than 30 cm of space for my
[53:24] knees and I could go all the way to the
[53:25] front, then I'd basically have no
[53:27] space for my knees and would sit like this, right
[53:29] ? So this is also very
[53:31] variable here. You can decide whether you want more
[53:32] cargo space or more room for your
[53:34] passengers in the second row of seats. Actually
[53:36] . We'll look at the
[53:37] other features here in Ionic.
[53:40] Of course, we have the big panorama here
[53:41] , but that's not what we're talking about right now
[53:43] . Up here we start with a
[53:44] few air vents directly on the roof lining.
[53:46] In fact, there is a
[53:48] safety handle with a small
[53:49] coat hook in it and an
[53:50] LED light as an entry light or
[53:52] as a reading light. Um, then we do
[53:55] n't have any hooks or anything here, but
[53:57] these beautiful Alcantara panels. In
[53:59] our car we also have the
[54:02] sun visors which we
[54:04] can fold out or pull out. They are
[54:06] also very useful if you are
[54:07] travelling with children, for example. They are
[54:09] included in the Technology version and also in
[54:11] our Unique. The materials are
[54:14] very nice, they are foamed on top, as is the
[54:16] case with this car. Um, then there's
[54:18] the faux leather again under this
[54:20] silver strip. So basically everything is
[54:21] exactly the same as before. Uh, then there are
[54:23] also a few
[54:25] bottle holders here, two in total,
[54:27] very large. I think that's a good
[54:28] thing. The floor is a bit
[54:30] ridged there. The window switch
[54:32] is located directly behind it, right?
[54:34] You see, right? The window is a
[54:35] little tinted, right? rear. Um, and there's
[54:38] a faux leather armrest.
[54:39] The ambient lighting is also located at the bottom back in
[54:41] another
[54:43] large compartment, just like at the front with
[54:45] this milky glass look, you could
[54:47] say, as a plastic cover and then another
[54:49] large storage compartment, just like the
[54:50] Bose speakers down here. Um,
[54:53] so far so good on the site. Then there's
[54:55] a
[54:58] little compartment in the seat in front of me. It's like
[55:00] a kind of map pocket, you could say,
[55:02] right? It's made a bit hard
[55:04] , but covered in faux leather.
[55:06] Um, what I also find quite interesting is that
[55:07] you have USB-C charging ports directly
[55:09] on the seats, so it's
[55:11] also very practical for those in the back, here
[55:13] on the passenger seat, and there in
[55:15] the middle you have this
[55:16] sliding center console.
[55:17] For example, you can open the one at the top from the
[55:19] back and access it too.
[55:21] You could put that in there next,
[55:23] right? But it's not actually refrigerated,
[55:24] right? That would also be quite practical.
[55:27] However, we also have a
[55:29] display here for the 3on
[55:30] automatic climate control.
[55:32] The car always has it with it. So
[55:34] here we have the auto function,
[55:35] for example.
[55:36] We can control the temperature
[55:37] up and down, for example.
[55:40] We also have a
[55:41] fan level that we can set. We
[55:43] can turn it off and we can
[55:44] set the standard seat heating or
[55:47] the seat cooling for the second
[55:49] row too, and that's also
[55:50] standard, so it's a really good
[55:52] thing. All of this is agreed upon here. There is
[55:54] another small compartment at the bottom that we
[55:56] can open here. That's what
[55:58] you saw earlier at the front, what
[55:59] you can look into at the front. Here, for example, it is
[56:02] nicely lined with non-slip material
[56:03] . We can still pack a lot of
[56:04] things in there. There really is
[56:06] immense space there. And we can also postpone the whole thing
[56:07] a little bit
[56:08] . You can see the
[56:09] cutout in the carpet here, right?
[56:11] We can also postpone that.
[56:12] By the way, I could have shown you a
[56:13] Preisst again earlier. I
[56:14] just forgot. But I have
[56:16] told you everything. Well, otherwise
[56:18] Isofix is ​​also included as standard, of course,
[56:20] with the two hooks at the bottom. The
[56:23] straps are attached in the middle. Also
[56:25] very interesting. People have to
[56:27] get used to it. Most people watch it there.
[56:28] Okay, but the Grot is in the
[56:29] middle here and there are also armrests
[56:31] that can be
[56:32] adjusted to different levels.
[56:34] I find that very comfortable.
[56:36] You can do that really well here.
[56:37] And as I said, there's
[56:40] the large panoramic roof on the roof. Um, and
[56:42] now let's look at the third
[56:44] row of seats. Entering the third
[56:45] row of seats is also made a little
[56:46] easier. We have a
[56:48] small button on the seat and then
[56:50] it folds forward semi-electrically
[56:51] . We can then push it forward
[56:52] , make the seat a little
[56:54] stronger, and then we can
[56:55] get in the back quite comfortably.
[56:59] You can now see me sitting here in the third
[57:00] row of seats. I'm going to sit down
[57:01] now, or rather sit
[57:03] directly behind me where I was just sitting, and
[57:05] you'll see. Okay, my knee room
[57:07] would be a bit limited now.
[57:08] Well, I'd pretty much have none left.
[57:10] By the way, you can also use the red loop here
[57:12] if you are sitting in the back
[57:13] and want to have the seat pushed forward so you can
[57:16] get out. The whole thing also has
[57:17] an easy entry function. So, the seat
[57:19] ends exactly where you just had it.
[57:21] But I don't want that now. That's why
[57:23] I'm going to move it
[57:24] a little bit forward with the little bar that's at the front
[57:26] and put it a
[57:27] little bit in the middle position. And
[57:29] now I would have enough space to
[57:30] sit and lo and behold, now I can
[57:32] really sit properly here in the third row of seats
[57:34] . So the third
[57:35] row of seats here in the Ionic 9 isn't a
[57:38] penalty box, but rather a really good
[57:39] option for six people to
[57:41] drive. And the people back here still
[57:43] have enough comfort.
[57:45] Sure, the bench is definitely a bit shorter
[57:46] than the single seat in the
[57:48] back. It's not quite as
[57:49] elegant, but there is still Isofix in the
[57:52] back, for example, and the headrests
[57:54] are high enough.
[57:56] Unfortunately, you can't adjust it a little bit,
[57:57] no, you can't adjust it upwards
[57:58] , right? For me it just about works
[58:00] . I have a bottle holder here on
[58:02] the left side. Then there is also
[58:04] the possibility to adjust the seat
[58:07] differently. E.g. at the back. I
[58:08] can also assume a lying position like that
[58:10] again if I want to.
[58:11] I can even adjust the electrically in the third row of seats. The
[58:13] comfort
[58:15] I have here is immense
[58:17] and I even have a
[58:19] USB-C port in the back to charge my phone, for example
[58:22] with 100 watts of power on the left
[58:25] side. So you ca
[58:27] n't really do that well yet. And the
[58:28] third row of seats in the Ionic 9 is no
[58:31] penalty box. We also have
[58:32] a few more ventilation openings up here.
[58:35] So it's really
[58:37] comfortable even back here. There's quite
[58:39] a lot to do with the Ionic 9
[58:41] . Of course
[58:43] there's a lot in the trunk too. The tailgate can be
[58:45] opened electrically as standard.
[58:47] I haven't seen a sensor function yet
[58:48] , maybe it's just not
[58:50] activated. I'll
[58:51] send it to you again later. We have a
[58:53] trunk volume here that we
[58:55] can have in very different ways. We have
[58:56] 338
[58:58] l when the third row of seats
[59:01] is up. And that's still pretty
[59:02] decent. If we
[59:03] fold down the third row of seats, we can
[59:05] load a maximum of 908 l. So that's
[59:07] quite a lot, almost 1000 l as a
[59:10] trunk. Close behind the second
[59:11] row of seats. If we also fold down the second row of seats
[59:13] , we have 2494
[59:17] l of trunk volume. Well that's
[59:19] quite a lot, since the car is big,
[59:21] but it also has a big
[59:23] interior. You also have the
[59:25] option of ordering a trailer
[59:26] hitch for the
[59:28] car. With the
[59:29] rear-wheel drive version, you can then
[59:31] take a maximum of 1.6 tons. With
[59:35] all-wheel drive, the maximum
[59:38] braked trailer load is 2.5 tonnes. Let's take
[59:41] a look inside the trunk of the
[59:42] Ionic 9. And as you can see, there
[59:45] isn't much space behind the third row of seats
[59:46] , but there's still
[59:48] plenty.
[59:50] You could
[59:52] say that the car has
[59:53] a trunk, almost like a Golf or a Polo. Uh, we then have the
[59:55] third row of seats, which can be
[59:58] folded down electrically from the Technique variant onwards
[59:59] , i.e. from the middle row onwards.
[01:00:01] We have the buttons here
[01:00:02] on the right side and it's very
[01:00:05] extensive. There you can see, for example, second
[01:00:07] row, third row. Folding the second row
[01:00:09] electrically is only possible if
[01:00:10] we have a six-seater package,
[01:00:12] not the seven-seater. Then there would be
[01:00:14] a remote unlocking, but no
[01:00:15] electric folding option. In the
[01:00:17] third row we have this from
[01:00:19] the tech technology onwards, as I said. Then
[01:00:21] it goes electrically once on the
[01:00:22] right side, once on the left
[01:00:24] side. The headrests then fold down
[01:00:25] a little. Exactly. And then
[01:00:28] we can fold down the third row of seats here.
[01:00:30] And then we also have the 908 l
[01:00:32] trunk volume. There is then a
[01:00:34] flexible cover. Okay, you can
[01:00:36] then put that forward again.
[01:00:38] Then a little bit here too, right? There
[01:00:39] 's a flap underneath,
[01:00:40] so to speak. Well, how is it? That's the way it is.
[01:00:42] Zack. Exactly. A reversible mat and
[01:00:44] you can use it to
[01:00:46] level out these steps. Unfortunately it stays in front, there
[01:00:47] is no other way. Um,
[01:00:49] otherwise we also have the
[01:00:50] option to fold down the second row.
[01:00:52] Then it goes here, for example, zack and
[01:00:55] then zack. This is a bit, um,
[01:00:57] yes, a bit more commercially available
[01:00:59] you could say, but you can see that
[01:01:01] we have a big suitcase now. Okay, what
[01:01:03] other function do we have back here?
[01:01:04] But there is a small light. There is
[01:01:06] also the
[01:01:07] option to open the tailgate
[01:01:08] under this small flap.
[01:01:10] Also very interesting is that we have a 12 volt supply
[01:01:12] here for charging
[01:01:13] devices. There are Verzorösen,
[01:01:15] but they are made of plastic, which
[01:01:16] I don't find very attractive. We also have
[01:01:18] Verzorösen. Look here,
[01:01:20] there too and of course here too.
[01:01:22] I find this quite interesting. This
[01:01:24] appears to be the
[01:01:26] vehicle's emergency shutdown. If you can open things here
[01:01:28] , then we can take the thing
[01:01:29] off. We have a switch like that downstairs
[01:01:30] . So very, very interesting.
[01:01:32] Um, otherwise we also have a
[01:01:34] 12 230 volt socket here with a maximum
[01:01:37] load of 250 volts and 16 amps, so
[01:01:39] we can use that once,
[01:01:42] or at least it can be used like that too.
[01:01:44] Uh, but it's not our German
[01:01:46] layout, I think, right? No, it does
[01:01:48] n't look like that to me. Okay, we'll close it again
[01:01:50] . Up there were the buttons that I
[01:01:51] just used to make adjustments and
[01:01:53] here again the LED lighting
[01:01:54] on the right side. So
[01:01:57] what we can use here is really very, very extensive
[01:01:58] . Uh, in the trunk of the
[01:02:00] Ionic. No, what I don't have in the car
[01:02:02] , I find quite
[01:02:03] interesting, do I have a trunk,
[01:02:05] a trunk, because I have
[01:02:07] n't found that yet, unless I give you
[01:02:09] complete junk and it
[01:02:10] might be under the floor.
[01:02:12] We'll look at it again together now,
[01:02:13] because I can open it. Oh yes,
[01:02:14] of course. I've been talking a bit of
[01:02:16] nonsense again, because the cover
[01:02:18] is located right here in the floor.
[01:02:19] You can put them in here. I also find it
[01:02:21] very practical if you
[01:02:22] can slide it in here, because if you
[01:02:23] want to fold it over, right? So, it's
[01:02:25] there, right? Otherwise you could
[01:02:27] also put a warning triangle in here,
[01:02:28] right? That fits in well too. There are
[01:02:29] a few accessories in here, like a few nets
[01:02:31] , a small bag, and so
[01:02:33] on. So the car is already very
[01:02:35] well equipped with all kinds of
[01:02:37] things that we can use here. And
[01:02:38] we can set the whole thing up with a
[01:02:40] little hook here, right? So
[01:02:41] very practically implemented. The passenger
[01:02:44] seat backrest in the Hyundai Ionic 9
[01:02:46] is not foldable, but I don't think
[01:02:48] anyone will miss that given the amount of
[01:02:49] space. And now let’s take another look at it
[01:02:50] based on the dimensions.
[01:02:53] The trunk width here
[01:02:55] in the back, with the seats
[01:02:57] up, is 1.35 m, which is
[01:03:00] really quite decent. Then
[01:03:02] again, with the third
[01:03:03] row of seats up, I have a length of the
[01:03:04] trunk up to the shortest
[01:03:07] point of about 55 cm. It's okay,
[01:03:10] but it's not huge. The
[01:03:12] trunk height here at
[01:03:14] the back is only 73 cm. Then I notice
[01:03:17] that the car tapers a bit
[01:03:18] towards the back. Then I can
[01:03:20] also fold down the third row of seats
[01:03:22] . That would be here on the
[01:03:25] page. Let's fold down here.
[01:03:27] Uh, that takes a while, it's
[01:03:28] electric, of course. And then we can
[01:03:30] see what the length is after the
[01:03:33] second row of seats
[01:03:34] . I've now
[01:03:36] pushed the single seat all the way back, and
[01:03:38] I now have a length of 1.23
[01:03:41] m. But if I now
[01:03:43] fold down the second row of seats and
[01:03:45] push the passenger seat all the way forward,
[01:03:47] I again have a length of—
[01:03:49] I hope my tape measure is long enough—
[01:03:51] exactly 2.35
[01:03:54] m at the shortest point. So really
[01:03:56] quite a lot. We'll take a look at
[01:03:58] how high the tailgate is.
[01:04:00] By the way, you have to be careful because it
[01:04:02] 's not that high. I'm 1.80 m tall and
[01:04:04] have just about 2 cm of space left.
[01:04:07] If you jump up behind here,
[01:04:09] you would reach the trunk lock.
[01:04:10] So please be careful, don't get a
[01:04:12] headbutt. The tailgate opens to
[01:04:14] a maximum height of around 2 m,
[01:04:18] you could say, but it's better to plan for 2.10
[01:04:20] m for the garage. And you also have
[01:04:24] a height from the loading sill. That's
[01:04:26] quite decent here, because the car
[01:04:28] has a tapered rear
[01:04:29] of about 80 cm. We're sitting in the
[01:04:33] biggest Hyundai of all again and are now driving
[01:04:35] into town. This brings me to the
[01:04:38] point where I can talk about the chassis
[01:04:40] , about the comfort, but also about
[01:04:42] the dynamics in this car, and at the beginning
[01:04:44] I mentioned that the car wants to
[01:04:45] be comfortable. Can he do it?
[01:04:48] We've already seen the interior: great seats,
[01:04:49] ventilation, massage, everything. Um,
[01:04:53] but what about the chassis?
[01:04:54] First of all, there is a normal
[01:04:55] steel chassis. In fact, we do
[01:04:57] n't have any air suspension that
[01:04:59] would fit the car well. Um, and actually
[01:05:02] no adjustable dampers either.
[01:05:04] He approaches what we have relatively normally
[01:05:06] . Um, but I think I've seen from
[01:05:09] the springs and the entire structure at the
[01:05:11] rear that the car
[01:05:13] has level control at the rear,
[01:05:16] but this works via the dampers
[01:05:17] and not via
[01:05:19] air suspension. There's another small
[01:05:21] difference. Um, how does the whole
[01:05:24] car drive? Very comfortable. So,
[01:05:27] as I said, we don't have air suspension. The car
[01:05:29] doesn't react as smoothly to bumps, but
[01:05:31] it still falls off very well and
[01:05:33] you can see it here too. I'll take
[01:05:35] this Gulideckel with me straight away,
[01:05:36] right? Sure, I hear all that stuff,
[01:05:38] but I don't really
[01:05:40] notice the bumps. So, the
[01:05:41] car really decouples you from the
[01:05:43] road. Um, and that makes driving easier,
[01:05:46] especially in busy, traffic-
[01:05:48] plagued inner cities or even in
[01:05:50] rural areas. I have a few
[01:05:51] cross joints here.
[01:05:53] Yes, the car moves a bit,
[01:05:55] but it is always comfortable. What you
[01:05:57] also have to pay for, however, is a
[01:05:59] certain lateral inclination. Sure, the car
[01:06:01] is heavy and high. Um, we have 21-
[01:06:05] inch rims, which actually look quite small here
[01:06:06] , because we
[01:06:08] still have enough tires on the
[01:06:10] car. We actually have 285s in width
[01:06:12] too. Um, well, I find
[01:06:15] the car very comfortable.
[01:06:17] However, the sea is bought with a certain
[01:06:18] amount of clumsiness, which I expected from a
[01:06:21] 56 long SUV with almost 2.8 tons
[01:06:24] . Now I have
[01:06:25] a few bumps in the
[01:06:27] road, right? Irons everything nicely and smoothly.
[01:06:29] Well, I really like that, when
[01:06:31] I set the driving modes here, it's
[01:06:33] not different, right? So that’s it
[01:06:36] . For me, noise reduction is also a factor in terms of comfort
[01:06:38] .
[01:06:40] Hyundai has really pulled out all the stops,
[01:06:43] as you could say today, because we
[01:06:44] have acoustic glazing all around the front,
[01:06:47] but also in the side windows,
[01:06:49] so we're sitting in a real
[01:06:51] cocoon, you could say, and the outside world
[01:06:53] is shielded, right? I've
[01:06:56] experienced it being a bit quiet in
[01:06:58] various other vehicles, but
[01:07:00] I'm doing really well
[01:07:02] and, as I said, I'm sitting here in
[01:07:03] a cocoon and I have my own quiet
[01:07:05] world inside me, I only notice a little bit of
[01:07:08] the outside world, right? This makes it really
[01:07:10] discreet and very quiet. I
[01:07:14] think it just has to be that way with an electric car
[01:07:15] , because with an electric car you notice
[01:07:17] the external noises much more
[01:07:19] because we don't
[01:07:20] have an engine sound, right? And that makes it
[01:07:22] really good. Everything in here is
[01:07:24] also very well built. We have no
[01:07:25] rattling, no creaking. So Hyundai does this
[01:07:27] really well. Hyundai does
[01:07:30] n’t really claim to be a premium brand.
[01:07:32] But with this car you can actually notice it
[01:07:33] a little bit.
[01:07:35] We have standard brake technology with
[01:07:37] disc brakes at the front and rear. But they are
[01:07:38] also necessary with such a high
[01:07:40] weight. Now let's give it a
[01:07:41] bit of gas and see how the
[01:07:43] chassis reacts when I
[01:07:44] drive at 100 km/h across the country.
[01:07:47] He's doing really well at that right now. Um, yes,
[01:07:50] driving over bumps here
[01:07:52] at such high speed is no problem at all
[01:07:54] . Won't he get pushy or anything,
[01:07:56] right? We also have a very long
[01:07:57] bike, over 3 meters long, and that makes it
[01:08:00] very comfortable. Let's also
[01:08:02] come to the steering. I'm
[01:08:04] in normal mode now and it's responding
[01:08:05] really well. It's a bit
[01:08:07] soft, you could say, but it
[01:08:09] just fits well with this comfortable car.
[01:08:11] I wouldn't
[01:08:12] criticize that either. Of course I can
[01:08:13] go into sport mode here, right? Then
[01:08:15] it reacts a bit more directly and
[01:08:18] simply takes out a bit of
[01:08:19] servo support.
[01:08:21] But I don't need it for my driving habits. I
[01:08:23] would stay in normal mode and
[01:08:25] just enjoy this slight fixability
[01:08:28] a little bit. You can see
[01:08:29] where the car fits. The car
[01:08:31] just fits a little bit in the USA.
[01:08:33] But it would definitely be one of the
[01:08:35] cars with the best chassis and the
[01:08:37] best steering. What isn't so good
[01:08:40] is the turning circle. But hey, with such a
[01:08:42] huge car, we have a turning circle
[01:08:44] of 12.5 meters. That's quite a
[01:08:46] lot, and
[01:08:48] the car couldn't manage my home turnaround. And if
[01:08:50] I were to drive this car on a daily basis,
[01:08:52] I think I would choose my
[01:08:53] parking garages, especially in downtown Berlin
[01:08:55] , based on where the car would
[01:08:57] fit comfortably without
[01:08:59] having to reverse three times just to make a turn
[01:09:01] . You have to
[01:09:03] be aware of that. So, if you're not really
[01:09:05] into the city centers,
[01:09:06] for example, then that wouldn't be a problem at all
[01:09:08] . If you are a frequent user,
[01:09:11] I might reconsider choosing the Ionic 9
[01:09:13] .
[01:09:16] Let's move on to the topic of security.
[01:09:17] With Hyundai’s large electric SUV. In the
[01:09:21] Euro Endcap Crash Test, the car
[01:09:23] received a full 5 stars. So the
[01:09:25] top rating is evidence of good
[01:09:27] occupant safety, but also
[01:09:29] good pedestrian protection.
[01:09:31] This is not so easy, especially for a large SUV
[01:09:33] . There are seven airbags in the series
[01:09:36] , at least according to the price list.
[01:09:38] But I have two more side
[01:09:40] airbags in the swiveling seat pods.
[01:09:44] This would increase the number to nine
[01:09:46] , although I didn't read that in the
[01:09:48] price list. I
[01:09:50] also awakened the center, which
[01:09:53] protects me from interaction with the passenger. When driving, I increase
[01:09:57] my comfort, but also my
[01:09:58] safety, with many
[01:09:59] driver assistance systems, most
[01:10:01] of which come as standard. For example, an
[01:10:05] emergency braking assistant, which is
[01:10:07] supposed to also detect pedestrians and cyclists,
[01:10:08] fortunately did not give any
[01:10:10] false alarms in my test. I also have a
[01:10:11] lane keeping assistant, which I can
[01:10:12] show you now. I have quite
[01:10:14] strong sun exposure. Now there is a risk of
[01:10:16] crossing the right lane. The
[01:10:18] car steers me back too confidently.
[01:10:19] I can take a look at that in the middle too
[01:10:21] . The tracks are really
[01:10:22] washed out and, yes, okay, I have
[01:10:26] a left turn, which makes it
[01:10:27] quite difficult, but the car recognizes
[01:10:28] them and steers me straight. Exactly,
[01:10:30] also warn me that I should
[01:10:31] put my hands on the steering wheel again
[01:10:33] . I think all of this is very well
[01:10:35] implemented.
[01:10:37] The Ionic 9 also has a drowsiness detection system.
[01:10:39] I have a camera
[01:10:42] right on the steering column. She
[01:10:44] just told me
[01:10:46] that my eyes aren't visible either
[01:10:48] . That was probably
[01:10:49] because of my sunglasses. So, unfortunately, you have
[01:10:51] a warning message. This is only possible
[01:10:53] without sunglasses. In fact,
[01:10:55] the Ionic 9 also has traffic sign recognition
[01:10:57] , which also comes as standard and
[01:11:00] reliably recognizes traffic signs.
[01:11:02] But as is usually the case with
[01:11:03] assistance systems, I then have the
[01:11:05] problem that temporary
[01:11:08] speed limits are not
[01:11:09] recognized correctly. This is also the
[01:11:11] case here in the car. In addition to the
[01:11:14] lane keeping assistant, you also have
[01:11:16] a lane following assistant as standard.
[01:11:18] You can also activate it here. Do
[01:11:19] you have a small steering wheel in this car
[01:11:21] ? Then, even without having to
[01:11:23] activate the ACC system, you can
[01:11:28] drive directly with just your fingers on the steering wheel,
[01:11:30] lightly on the steering wheel. The steering wheel is
[01:11:33] also capacitive, meaning it recognizes
[01:11:34] your touch and now steers
[01:11:36] reliably, without me having to
[01:11:38] use ACC, even between lanes and keeps
[01:11:41] me in the middle of the lane
[01:11:43] rather than just oscillating between lanes.
[01:11:45] However, I also think it's very good that
[01:11:47] my favorite driver assistance system,
[01:11:49] CM ACC, or adaptive cruise control, is
[01:11:51] included as standard and I can
[01:11:53] theoretically activate it on the left side. Um,
[01:11:56] I would have to activate the system once
[01:11:57] , SCC activated, distance 1
[01:12:00] would now be set here, right? I
[01:12:02] can adjust the distance here to
[01:12:02] different levels. Distance 4, 3,
[01:12:05] 2 or 1 and I can now
[01:12:08] go to set here and would now
[01:12:10] program the 100 km/h that
[01:12:12] I am allowed to drive here. Um, now
[01:12:15] the car in one test maintains the
[01:12:16] speed like a normal
[01:12:17] cruise control, but it would also maintain the distance
[01:12:19] to the car in front if I
[01:12:21] had someone in front of me. Um, the whole thing is
[01:12:24] already in the area of ​​the STVO, even if
[01:12:26] you only have distance 1,
[01:12:28] the minimum distance, so to speak. Also
[01:12:30] included is the
[01:12:32] possibility of adopting the traffic signs
[01:12:34] . But you have to
[01:12:35] activate this manually in the vehicle.
[01:12:38] You can also activate this here via the system
[01:12:39] . Let's see if that
[01:12:40] 's activated, because then it will offer
[01:12:42] me the option to adopt this directly using the button
[01:12:44] . We're about to reach 100,
[01:12:47] then 70. However, it might
[01:12:50] be a bit tight now because
[01:12:51] the traffic light is red. Um, we'll take a look at
[01:12:53] it right now anyway. I'll
[01:12:54] just brake a little
[01:12:55] harder. Let's see
[01:12:57] if he wants to take over the 70 for me now
[01:12:58] , right? And yes, it detected the 70
[01:13:02] , but we need to check if it's
[01:13:04] activated. We can do that right now at
[01:13:06] the red light. That's why
[01:13:07] red traffic lights are very useful.
[01:13:11] This system also includes the
[01:13:14] adoption of traffic signs. But the whole thing
[01:13:16] can only be done manually. Um, so I
[01:13:19] have to press a button. I have
[01:13:20] now set up the system so that
[01:13:22] the whole thing will be adopted. Here is the
[01:13:24] 60 and I can go up
[01:13:26] to set once, so to speak, and the car
[01:13:28] will then take on the new speed.
[01:13:30] But I have to confirm it with a button;
[01:13:31] it doesn't happen automatically,
[01:13:33] and that takes a bit of time
[01:13:34] , I think. An increase is
[01:13:36] not a problem now. I can now
[01:13:37] go to plus. He's already
[01:13:39] adjusted it back to 70, right? That's no
[01:13:41] problem. But I think it's more of a
[01:13:43] problem if I have new speed limits
[01:13:45] that are lower than the
[01:13:47] previous ones. Then I end up driving
[01:13:48] through the, um, prohibited
[01:13:52] zone for quite a long time at too high a speed,
[01:13:53] you could say. Uh, I find that
[01:13:55] a bit super subtle.
[01:13:58] A stop and go assistant would also be
[01:14:00] included. So, if you approach a traffic light
[01:14:02] with the ACC system and there is
[01:14:04] someone in front of you who is braking,
[01:14:06] the car will then brake to a stop
[01:14:07] and then
[01:14:09] start again accordingly.
[01:14:11] We'll take another look at the entire system in
[01:14:13] interaction once the
[01:14:14] Renault Trafik has driven
[01:14:16] onto the
[01:14:18] miracle road at its rather leisurely speed. We'll
[01:14:19] stay behind that for a moment and take
[01:14:21] another look at System H and how it
[01:14:22] reacts when I have someone in front of me
[01:14:23] . I go to set here once, and
[01:14:26] then I can go back up to
[01:14:28] the 100 that I'm allowed to go here,
[01:14:30] at least for now. And now we have
[01:14:32] the 80. Let's see
[01:14:33] how the system handles this. So
[01:14:35] now I have this here and I can go
[01:14:37] to 100 here but now the 100 has been
[01:14:40] taken over. I want the 80. And
[01:14:42] that's the problem I was just talking about
[01:14:44] . He just keeps driving at
[01:14:46] 100 if I don't
[01:14:47] confirm it quickly enough. We'll put the
[01:14:49] steering assistant back in and take
[01:14:51] another look at the whole thing here. He
[01:14:53] also says that the steering wheel should
[01:14:54] be capacitive. In other words, it detects the slight
[01:14:57] tension in my fingertips and I
[01:14:59] only have to hold the steering wheel very lightly
[01:15:00] . We look at each other. We're following
[01:15:02] behind the tobacconist's here.
[01:15:04] Distance 1 is set, right? so that
[01:15:07] you can compare it again and
[01:15:09] after that I can drive a little bit
[01:15:10] faster. I also have
[01:15:11] a few curves up ahead, so I can
[01:15:13] show you more detail there.
[01:15:15] Exactly, the car in front of me is accelerating
[01:15:17] now. Now you can also
[01:15:18] see the 120 km/h. Exactly, he
[01:15:21] updated it, even automatically,
[01:15:23] right? So, I don't have to
[01:15:24] do this manually now, actually. And now let
[01:15:26] 's see how you follow the tracks here
[01:15:27] with the steering assistant. We
[01:15:30] have quite powerful tracks,
[01:15:31] especially for this speed. That
[01:15:33] 's the 100 km/h. The car in front of me is
[01:15:35] driving relatively slowly and we wait to see
[01:15:38] how the curve continues before
[01:15:39] I overtake the car. He's doing
[01:15:41] really well here. He's driving a
[01:15:44] little too far to the left, I think, but that's
[01:15:46] okay. It then centers itself
[01:15:47] quite well in the middle of the
[01:15:49] lane. It's not an
[01:15:51] autopilot, it's a
[01:15:52] driver assistance system, right? And
[01:15:54] apparently you only have to hold the steering wheel very lightly
[01:15:55] . The car doesn't warn me to
[01:15:59] put my fingers on the steering wheel. I think that's a very
[01:16:00] good thing. Okay, let's pull out for a moment and
[01:16:02] you'll see another
[01:16:03] driver assistance system, the
[01:16:05] blind spot warning system. In my
[01:16:08] version, which is only
[01:16:09] included in the technical specifications, it has cameras that display
[01:16:12] when a vehicle
[01:16:14] appears in the blind spot. Um, I think that's
[01:16:16] very good. There you have
[01:16:18] the acoustic warning. Theoretically you
[01:16:20] have just adjusted the warning, um,
[01:16:24] oh, to 100 km/h,
[01:16:26] actually, right? He just
[01:16:27] saw that too. Very good. And uh, we'll see
[01:16:29] who moves on. Um, and the
[01:16:31] nice thing about the blind spot system is that
[01:16:33] you have the camera view, you theoretically have the
[01:16:35] warning with the sign on the
[01:16:38] car, so to speak, you have
[01:16:40] the whole thing in the mirror glass and the acoustic
[01:16:43] warning. Uh, I think that's a good
[01:16:44] thing, as I said, but this
[01:16:45] camera view is only available from the technology level onwards.
[01:16:47] What I also have as standard is
[01:16:49] the Tinkel Warner and also a
[01:16:51] rear cross traffic assistant when
[01:16:53] I'm pulling out of a confusing
[01:16:55] parking space, which can
[01:16:56] often be the case with a large car. Let’s
[01:16:59] briefly talk about the
[01:17:01] car’s lighting. We have LED spotlights in the series
[01:17:04] . If we choose at least the
[01:17:06] technology variant, the Matrix
[01:17:08] LED projectors will also be included in the series.
[01:17:11] My car has it too. We have
[01:17:12] the Unique, the best Ionic. No,
[01:17:14] I think it's a good thing that they
[01:17:16] 're already there. However, a static
[01:17:18] high beam assistant would always have been part
[01:17:20] of the series. Like all Hyundai Ionic models,
[01:17:24] the largest, Number 9, has
[01:17:26] an 800-volt system, meaning it can
[01:17:30] charge very quickly. That's why
[01:17:31] the Hyundai Insta and the
[01:17:33] Hyundai Kona are not Ionic models, because
[01:17:35] they have a 400-volt system. In
[01:17:39] this case with the Ionic 9, that means
[01:17:41] a battery of 110 kilowatt hours
[01:17:44] gross, which is 106 kilowatt hours
[01:17:47] net at that moment. We can charge
[01:17:49] the car at the back right. I'll take you
[01:17:51] with me. This is what the loading flap looks like.
[01:17:54] It opens electrically. You have to
[01:17:56] pull over once, but you can also do it inside your car
[01:17:58] . There we have
[01:18:00] the Type 2 connection and below that
[01:18:02] the connection for CCS, so the two
[01:18:05] extra noses, so to speak. We don't have any
[01:18:07] weird caps or anything that we have to
[01:18:09] take out here. I find that very
[01:18:11] practical and you can also lock it
[01:18:13] using the button that we
[01:18:15] have inside. We can charge the car via
[01:18:18] Ai, i.e. via alternating current, e.g. at your
[01:18:21] home wallbox. That's no
[01:18:23] problem. This also works with the Ionic 9.
[01:18:27] However, the charging time is a whopping 10 hours. The
[01:18:29] battery is simply very large and
[01:18:31] Hyundai states this value from 10 to
[01:18:34] 100%. But the real highlight is
[01:18:37] the fast charging. On the Ionic 9, for example. Here
[01:18:40] at Fastnet, at such a charging station,
[01:18:42] we can charge the car with a maximum of 233 kW
[01:18:46] and this lasts for a
[01:18:48] very long time thanks to the 800 volt
[01:18:51] system, which ensures a charging time of
[01:18:53] 24 minutes from 10 to 80%. 24
[01:18:57] minutes doesn't sound like much at first
[01:18:59] , but you have to know how much
[01:19:01] energy goes into this 110 kilowatt-hour
[01:19:03] battery. That's
[01:19:06] quite a lot, and Hyundai then gives the value
[01:19:08] from 10 to 80%. I
[01:19:12] already mentioned while driving that a
[01:19:13] heat pump is standard. The
[01:19:16] option to precondition the car
[01:19:17] is also
[01:19:19] included as standard. This can be done either
[01:19:21] via route guidance or manually via the
[01:19:24] infotainment system. And there is
[01:19:26] also an app for the Hyundai Ionic 9 called
[01:19:29] Blueelink, like all other
[01:19:31] Hyundai models. Works very well
[01:19:33] there too. Praise to Hyundai.
[01:19:36] Connecting the car to the app was
[01:19:38] very easy. I've had
[01:19:39] a completely different experience with other hashes,
[01:19:41] with a lot of unpleasantness. This happened
[01:19:44] very quickly here. In this app,
[01:19:46] for example - I've taken a few screenshots for you here -
[01:19:47] you can, for example, remotely
[01:19:49] control the car.
[01:19:52] But it even goes so far that you
[01:19:53] can open the car. You can
[01:19:55] send a router to the car or,
[01:19:56] of course, you can also
[01:19:58] pre-condition the car, which is a
[01:20:01] real advantage for
[01:20:03] electric vehicles in winter. There is also the
[01:20:05] Vehicle to Load function in the vehicle from
[01:20:08] the middle variant onwards. In terms of technology,
[01:20:10] an adapter is also included, with which you
[01:20:15] can, for example, operate external devices on the power supply or with the car's power supply,
[01:20:17] e.g. charge a coffee machine or an e-bike
[01:20:19] or whatever. That can
[01:20:20] also be quite practical. Of course, Hyundai also offers you a
[01:20:23] warranty on everything related to the battery.
[01:20:27] This is the typical term of a
[01:20:29] maximum of 8 years or a maximum of 160,000
[01:20:33] km, whichever comes first.
[01:20:36] Okay, we can argue about the practicality of an
[01:20:39] electric SUV over 5 meters long,
[01:20:42] but not about the quality
[01:20:44] and implementation of the Hyundai Ionic 9.
[01:20:47] While it's no Bentley Ben Tiger or
[01:20:50] Rolls-Royce Cinan,
[01:20:52] it's certainly very special in its price range
[01:20:53] and offers very good quality.
[01:20:56] Not everything in the interior is of
[01:20:57] high quality, but it is very
[01:21:00] versatile and also quite large. This makes it
[01:21:03] a very good replacement.
[01:21:05] Also remarkable is the comfort that
[01:21:07] the car offers in terms of noise reduction and seating
[01:21:09] comfort, for example, even
[01:21:11] if you will probably rarely use such a relaxation function in the
[01:21:12] first row of seats
[01:21:15] .
[01:21:17] The Ionic 9 is also a very good electric car, as
[01:21:19] it takes the good features from the
[01:21:22] smaller Ionic models, such as the
[01:21:24] 800-volt charging system, but also the
[01:21:26] car's good efficiency.
[01:21:29] Hyundai's new flagship shows what the Koreans
[01:21:31] can now do, and that is
[01:21:33] quite a lot. What do you think about the Hyundai
[01:21:36] Ionic 9 or Ionic 9, whichever you
[01:21:38] prefer? Would this be a large electric SUV
[01:21:42] with lots of comfort for you? I'm very
[01:21:44] curious to hear your comments.
[01:21:46] Feel free to write them below this video.
[01:21:49] You can also tell me what
[01:21:50] you thought of my video. What did I
[01:21:52] do well? What should I
[01:21:53] perhaps optimize next time?
[01:21:54] I would be happy to receive your constructive criticism
[01:21:56] . I would also be very happy
[01:21:58] if you liked a video in
[01:22:00] this state.
[01:22:02] You can show me that, for example by liking it
[01:22:04] , sharing the video with your
[01:22:05] friends and acquaintances or, of course,
[01:22:07] by subscribing to
[01:22:09] my channel for free. See you again with the
[01:22:11] next test car. At this
[01:22:12] similar point here four wheels.
