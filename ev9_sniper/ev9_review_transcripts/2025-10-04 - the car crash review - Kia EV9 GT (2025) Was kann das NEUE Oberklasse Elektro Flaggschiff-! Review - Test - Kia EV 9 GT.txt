[00:03] This is the biggest car in the
[00:05] smallest space where we've ever had a
[00:08] static presentation. And with
[00:10] the Kia EV9 GT, I'm showing you today the
[00:14] best Kia of all time, because it
[00:17] now has 508 hp, goes to 100 in 4.6 seconds
[00:19] and is a luxury electric
[00:22] performance SUV. But what else can he do
[00:25] ? Yes, that's exactly what he'll find out here at
[00:26] Carrash Review, the sportiest, most
[00:29] luxurious of all car review channels.
[00:31] We have a new review every day at 5 p.m.
[00:34] for a small fee, similar to
[00:36] Jessie's Halle or a big one
[00:39] like my car. I'm J.
[00:41] Subscribe to the channel right now. What are
[00:43] we going to do today? We go
[00:45] around it. Let me put it this way: at least we're trying
[00:47] . We jump into the interior.
[00:49] I'll show you the front one and the back one.
[00:52] Trunk volume. We talk about
[00:53] range, about a battery, about
[00:54] price, about everything that interests the car nerd in
[00:57] you about me. Come with me.
[01:02] [Music]
[01:17] Yes, right at the beginning, before we get started,
[01:18] I would like to say thank you
[01:20] all to Jessie, because moderating
[01:22] today is actually like always, the film
[01:23] is just a bit more demanding and
[01:26] then we go straight to our
[01:27] cooperation partner Goeisy. What are
[01:29] they doing? They compare for you, even for a
[01:32] small fee, among the established
[01:35] leasing providers. feel free to stop by.
[01:36] It's a good thing. Now,
[01:38] however, a South Korean car
[01:40] review is being cooked up and I'm wondering a
[01:42] bit about the Kia: who needs a
[01:45] Genesis anymore? It's so
[01:47] luxurious, it's so big, it's
[01:49] really crazy. And when I first
[01:52] saw it, when it
[01:53] came to Germany, that was in 2003, I
[01:56] said, "Wow, awesome car! I think
[01:58] the looks are really cool, too." And it's
[02:00] based on the EGMP platform, just
[02:03] like the Kia EV6 GT.
[02:06] Just like the Hyundai Ionic 9, just
[02:10] like the Genesis
[02:12] GV 60, just like the Hyundai Ionic 5N.
[02:17] I think I've got them all now
[02:18] . It's built in
[02:20] South Korea and probably also in the USA, and
[02:24] the class could be described as an
[02:26] electric performance luxury SUV. But
[02:30] what else is there in this
[02:32] competitive environment? I'll tell you that
[02:34] briefly in a moment. The question for you,
[02:36] Jessie: What do you think,
[02:39] the GT is coming in 2025? How many has it
[02:40] sold in Germany already?
[02:43] 2,000. And with this one, they're
[02:46] hoping to generate even more sales,
[02:49] and most of the cars are
[02:51] sold with all-wheel drive, which I
[02:53] found very interesting. Now to the
[02:55] competitive environment, what is it? A Cadillac
[02:57] Lyric, a Polaris. 3, a Volvo EX90. It
[03:02] 's not a Mercedes EQE SUV, but
[03:05] rather an EQS SUV, which
[03:06] is considerably larger. It's a BMW 1, which is
[03:10] perhaps a bit shapeless.
[03:13] It's the Hyundai Ionic 9, and um,
[03:17] yes, then you can see from the side
[03:19] that it's actually time to talk about the
[03:20] dimensions, because it's 5 meters,
[03:24] and that's where it's already run into the first Kia
[03:26] flag. It's one long, 1.98 meters wide,
[03:30] 1.78 meters high, and has a sensational
[03:32] wheelbase of
[03:34] 3.10 meters. You should have realized that by now
[03:36] . And when it comes to the
[03:39] equipment, it's the R Earth GT
[03:43] Line. You just realized
[03:45] that my English isn't the best.
[03:47] And now this full-blown GTV, which
[03:50] comes with a large, close to 100 kWh battery
[03:52] and 508 hp all-wheel drive. And if
[03:56] we look up now,
[03:58] you can see that it's not the new
[04:02] Panthera Metal color, and that it does
[04:04] n't have the glass roof either. A slightly
[04:07] flatter roof rail than the GT, yes, but
[04:11] it's Pepper Grey, and something new: at the
[04:14] front, there's now a camera that
[04:17] measures the road surface, and the
[04:19] adaptive damping, which is also new for the
[04:21] car, is supposed to
[04:23] adjust depending on the road surface. This almost
[04:26] never-ending hood is great.
[04:28] The Kia logo, sitting proudly at the front, is also great
[04:30] . We have ground clearance of 18 cm
[04:33] , a turning circle of
[04:34] 12.4 m, and a drag coefficient of just 0.28.
[04:38] Not good in absolute terms. Relatively
[04:41] speaking. However, in terms of size, it's
[04:43] very good in my opinion.
[04:45] And what's new about the car?
[04:47] I'll tell you that in a minute. First,
[04:49] we'll work our way into the headlights, and
[04:52] for the first time, we have a
[04:54] graphic inside that creates a great
[04:56] welcome and farewell signature
[04:58] , which you can also change later over the air
[05:00] for money—
[05:03] the entire signature, I suppose. And the whole thing is
[05:05] then reflected here in the
[05:07] main headlight, and the
[05:09] daytime running lights have been expanded, really
[05:12] powerful here. and runs
[05:14] jaggedly all the way down. While the
[05:17] bumper on the GT variant is slightly modified at the bottom,
[05:20] similar to the EV6 GT
[05:23] . To the front,
[05:25] we find a camera and there's
[05:27] an active radiator flap. Now
[05:30] we go to the side, and it's actually
[05:32] a bit boring for me to
[05:34] tell you about the looks. I'm
[05:35] more of a technical person. I
[05:37] never thought I'd
[05:39] say that. And then we talk about
[05:40] the wheelbase, which is very long, which
[05:43] is good on the highway. And then,
[05:45] for the first time, it has an adaptive
[05:47] adjustment system. It has an
[05:50] electronic limited-slip differential, and something
[05:53] completely new are electronically simulated
[05:55] gears. This means that through the sound in the car,
[05:59] you get the feeling that it's actually
[06:01] shifting gears. I think the first car to
[06:02] actually do that was the Ionic
[06:04] 5N. It basically reaped a lot of credit with that
[06:08] . The Kia EV6 GT is supposed to be
[06:11] able to do that too, and now it also
[06:14] simulates torque via, I
[06:16] think, a six-speed automatic transmission,
[06:18] so to speak. imitates. And
[06:21] then there's the all-wheel drive. The car is
[06:22] also available with rear-wheel drive. So we have
[06:24] one engine in the front
[06:28] and one in the rear. What's great about all-wheel drive compared
[06:30] to a combustion engine is that it has
[06:31] lightning-fast power distribution from rear
[06:33] to front or from front to rear,
[06:35] which is significantly better than a
[06:37] combustion engine. The weight is worse, as
[06:39] it weighs well over 2
[06:41] tons. Now let's look at the rims,
[06:43] and they're 21-inchers. That's
[06:46] certainly powerful on a GT, to be
[06:47] honest. Inside, there's also an
[06:49] enlarged brake system. I'm
[06:52] not quite sure how big yet. I know on the
[06:54] standard EV 9, I think it's 360 mm
[06:57] in the front and 345 mm in the rear. What's also new,
[07:01] similar to the Kia EV6 GT, are
[07:03] these neon-colored brake calipers up front,
[07:06] also with a GT on them.
[07:08] Really great, huge rims, and what
[07:10] also suits the car really well
[07:12] is that we've painted everything around the wheel
[07:14] arches and down the sill
[07:17] . The mirrors are available in
[07:20] digital for an extra charge; I'm not a fan.
[07:22] of them. Here are the analog ones, and
[07:25] for an additional charge, there's also a glass roof.
[07:27] We don't have either of those here.
[07:29] By the way, what I should and want to tell you
[07:31] is that this car is a pre-production model.
[07:33] But I think the quality inside
[07:34] is shockingly good.
[07:37] We have retractable door handles on the car for
[07:39] a better drag coefficient.
[07:41] I can get along with those quite well
[07:43] somehow. And if we
[07:44] look at the rear windows,
[07:46] they're tinted. The competitor,
[07:50] of course, is a Tesla Model X, for example.
[07:55] I've probably forgotten a few
[07:56] . Pretty crazy, actually. The
[07:58] Porsche Cayen is also coming with an
[07:59] electric version. How many luxury electric
[08:03] SUVs are there already? I've
[08:05] already mentioned the EQS.
[08:07] Yes. And now let's talk about charging.
[08:10] So, the battery is located deep in the
[08:12] underbody. There's one with a
[08:16] capacity of 76.1 kW/h. Then
[08:18] we have it either in the base version with 218 hp,
[08:21] as an all-wheel drive, or with less than 208 hp, and
[08:24] then there's an
[08:26] all-wheel drive, which then Just like the larger
[08:29] version has 99.8 kilowatts, almost a
[08:32] battery
[08:32] . Yes. And then it has 385 hp.
[08:38] Ours, however, has
[08:41] 508 hp. Now it's charging, and that's
[08:44] the great thing about the platform with
[08:48] a capacity of 210 kW, 800 volt
[08:52] technology, and I think it goes from 10 to 80% in 24 minutes, in
[08:55] 18 minutes, so really
[08:58] fast, and
[09:01] then it has a range of 450
[09:03] km. Now come a bit closer
[09:06] and we'll take a look at the tail light.
[09:08] Not much has changed at the back.
[09:10] Then at the top you can see a
[09:12] roof edge spoiler that extends very far down with
[09:14] a brake light, a camera to the
[09:16] rear, and also an integrated
[09:18] windshield wiper pointing downwards. The Kia logo is
[09:21] huge. It says IV9. The only thing that
[09:24] you can recognize as a GT at the back is the
[09:26] GT logo and the bumper at the bottom, which
[09:30] is also huge. Now let's open
[09:33] up the trunk volume, or rather the
[09:35] trunk. It's supposed to go over. Yes, it's
[09:38] not that easy today. 33 l. It's available
[09:41] as a six-seater and a seven-seater.
[09:43] It has that capacity when the rear bench
[09:44] is up. It then has almost
[09:47] 800 l when the third row of seats
[09:50] is folded down. It has 2300 or 2400 l of
[09:53] trunk volume, depending on how it is in the
[09:56] back. Jessie did
[09:58] n't prepare a light, of course, but that doesn't
[10:15] matter. There it is now. Okay, then we have double the cargo volume here, just downwards. What's nice is that there's a 12-volt socket on the side. On the other side, we can then manually open another trunk from the inside. There's a Way
[10:17] to Load function, also via this 250-
[10:20] volt socket. And if you
[10:22] want to take a look, we can, for example,
[10:23] fold down to the right or left, and then
[10:27] fold down the headrests up here as well
[10:29] . And we can do the same
[10:32] with the second row
[10:34] . And that's
[10:36] very, very luxurious, I'd say, don't
[10:38] you think? Crazy. Full like
[10:41] a spaceship. Full like A
[10:43] spaceship. And now we'll fold
[10:44] the second ones back up. Right,
[10:47] left, and then the third again.
[10:50] I really like that. Also in the back,
[10:51] that they have integrated cup holders
[10:53] . That's pretty awesome. If only
[10:55] someone had told me earlier that a Kia
[10:57] could do that. Hey, I think it's pretty awesome,
[10:59] because you'd expect something like that from
[11:01] BMW, Mercedes, Porsche,
[11:04] or maybe even Genesis, but
[11:06] yeah, really good, no kidding. And for
[11:09] the price, which I'll tell you later for the car
[11:12] , it's absolutely
[11:14] high, of course, but
[11:17] relative to the
[11:19] competition, it's actually
[11:21] pretty good. So, now I'm going to fold
[11:24] it
[11:25] forward. That's how it works. And I'm going to
[11:28] go to the back seat so you can still
[11:29] see in the back. If I have room there, there's
[11:32] probably room for your
[11:35] family too. Now, take a look at this
[11:38] . Let's turn on the lights
[11:40] back there so we can see something. Very
[11:42] good. Jessie has the light
[11:44] with her again. Let's wait until she's unpacked
[11:47] . Maybe it's so dark here. Inside. Yes,
[11:49] because there's no glass roof and it's a
[11:51] hall and also a dark sky
[11:53] interior. Now look at that. That
[11:55] 's really cool. I can also adjust
[11:56] the angle of the backrest from the back,
[11:59] forwards and backwards.
[12:02] Then there's a cup
[12:04] holder. I quite like that,
[12:06] honestly. You can sit really well in the back
[12:08] , right? And now I'm coming
[12:12] out again, folding it back, and
[12:16] at the same time going in on the other side,
[12:19] because that's pretty
[12:21] cool. You could really shuttle around with that
[12:24] . Then
[12:26] we'll turn on the light there,
[12:28] maybe on this side too. And
[12:30] now look
[12:31] , really nice bus driver
[12:35] armrests. Great
[12:37] space ratio in the GT now.
[12:39] Specifically in the back, there's this
[12:40] ambient lighting, this
[12:43] microfiber fabric thing in the seat. Then
[12:45] you have another
[12:47] extra compartment, one at the bottom. Huge
[12:51] flexibility, which is really great. And towards the
[12:54] front, you can adjust the seat here
[12:56] . You can do it in
[12:58] all directions here too. There's a USB port
[13:01] here, have it. There, you can put another
[13:02] cup holder in there
[13:04] . And my seats here are
[13:07] electrically adjustable, and because I'm
[13:09] currently suffering from back pain, you can
[13:11] also adjust them backwards. So
[13:13] much more luxury. I don't know about
[13:14] you. It's actually almost
[13:17] unimaginable. There's also cooling and
[13:19] heating for the rear seats. There's
[13:20] also cooling and heating for
[13:21] the rear seats. Exactly. Now
[13:23] I'm coming out. We'll see
[13:25] if there's a door sill panel in the back. There
[13:27] is. You can find cooling and heating
[13:30] here, and there's also a blind
[13:33] at the top. So, now take a look at
[13:36] this. Great workmanship. As I
[13:38] said, this is pre-production.
[13:40] Some manufacturers would dream of such a pre-production version
[13:42] . It's crazy what Kia is putting out these days
[13:44] , isn't it? Yes.
[13:47] Now we come to the drivetrain. We have to be
[13:49] honest
[13:50] , it needs some power.
[13:53] Why? Heavy. It's heavy. It
[13:56] probably weighs almost as much as an
[13:57] elephant. Nobody knows exactly what
[13:59] an elephant weighs. But it
[14:00] definitely has Much more power. It weighs
[14:02] well over 2 tons. Now it has
[14:04] 208 hp in the base version, then 200. No, 218,
[14:07] then 208. Or with all-wheel drive and a
[14:10] large battery, it has 385 hp. Here,
[14:14] however, we have significantly more
[14:16] power, namely 508 hp. That makes it sprint
[14:19] to 100 km/h in 4.6 seconds. It takes 6
[14:22] seconds with all-wheel drive without the GTline. With the
[14:25] GTline, it's 5.3. I don't know how faster it
[14:28] will be overall. I
[14:30] suspect that, like the Kia EV6 GT, it will
[14:33] probably reach well over 200 km/h
[14:35] , or rather, that they will
[14:38] be faster. And now take a look
[14:40] . Jan Frank is here in front.
[14:44] Jessie has already shown you. You do
[14:45] n't have to do much extra to
[14:46] refill the windshield washer fluid; it
[14:48] works here. Now I'd
[14:51] say let's go inside. I'll show
[14:54] you the
[14:55] interior. Yes, we
[14:57] just have to wait until
[14:59] you go to the back, right?
[15:01] Still Vehic Load function. It
[15:03] also has a vehicle load function.
[15:05] I've already told you about that. So feel free to come along.
[15:10] Yes, the car nerd in me is
[15:11] happy today, of course, because I've
[15:13] rarely, if ever, seen a better Kia
[15:16] interior, and overall,
[15:18] even in the competitive environment, it
[15:20] really doesn't have to hide. And now
[15:22] I'd say let's take a look at it,
[15:24] so you know what I'm talking about.
[15:26] We have an
[15:28] Alcantara synthetic leather interior with
[15:30] beautiful ambient lighting. It's
[15:32] incredibly heavily upholstered. So exactly what
[15:35] other manufacturers
[15:36] criticize is better here. What I would have
[15:38] liked to have had was the
[15:40] glass roof in here. Just for
[15:41] show, but we can
[15:43] do that sometime. Dark sky at the front. Touch
[15:45] -sensitive lights, which
[15:48] I quite like. So, relatively chic. There's
[15:50] a digital interior mirror.
[15:53] If we work our way towards the seats
[15:55] , though, you can see these GT
[15:57] seats here. It's a vegan seat. GT in
[16:01] the headrest towards the bottom.
[16:02] Pull element. These are everywhere in the interior.
[16:04] New elements. This has to
[16:07] be Alcantara with green stitching.
[16:10] The seats are heated, cooled,
[16:13] electrically adjustable, have a
[16:15] leg extension, and
[16:17] a
[16:18] massage function. You could
[16:20] n't really ask for much more, and in
[16:21] my case, you can even adjust them
[16:24] electrically, which is just great in
[16:26] my opinion. If we now pan
[16:28] past the GT steering wheel with
[16:31] a neon green GT button, which I'll
[16:33] show you later, you can see the
[16:36] ambient lighting at the front. You see that
[16:39] microfiber upholstery again. You see a nice
[16:40] decorative element. The interior manages to do
[16:43] quite well without piano lacquer, which
[16:46] is very important to me and
[16:48] worth mentioning these days. Then you have the
[16:50] decorative element at the top. You see the
[16:52] heating and the cooling on the side. You
[16:54] see a really well-padded
[16:56] armrest. You see a lot of upholstery in the
[16:59] door. It's robustly designed at the bottom,
[17:01] but I think it should
[17:02] be robust there. Is there a
[17:04] door sill? Very small. A
[17:06] small one, but at least there is one. And
[17:08] then we have a Glove compartment. If
[17:10] that's new, it's also been lined with sand
[17:11] . It's huge.
[17:14] Really good. You can see the trim there. And
[17:16] if we work our way down from this large
[17:18] 12.3-inch display (there's also
[17:21] one for the climate control at 5.3),
[17:23] you'll see buttons for
[17:25] the most important things, for the climate control, for
[17:27] the most important infotainment things. You can
[17:30] see a 12-volt,
[17:32] 100-watt socket towards the bottom. Really good.
[17:36] You can adjust it here, too. And the
[17:38] center console is used, because there's
[17:39] a large compartment at the bottom. Everything here is
[17:42] freely floating to the side towards the knee,
[17:44] really good coverage. At the
[17:46] front, we have this
[17:47] small compartment. There you can
[17:50] remove the cup holders,
[17:52] have them push out, or you can have the
[17:55] hill descent control. The camera, for example, is
[17:57] a 360° camera. If you
[17:59] 're here, we'll show it to you
[18:01] . Take a look
[18:03] . Really cool. And then you can see the
[18:06] inductive
[18:07] charging station here. Sorry. This is what
[18:09] the Key. And then I'd
[18:12] say, I'll turn on the
[18:14] hazard lights for you and tell you
[18:15] something at the same time. Yes, about these
[18:18] special functions. More and more
[18:19] car manufacturers are thinking, okay, we
[18:21] might be able to sell over-the-air updates
[18:23] . The light signature at the front, the
[18:25] goodbye and welcome, that's
[18:26] now flexible.
[18:28] I think that was already permitted with the standard
[18:30] EV9 in other markets at the beginning. Now
[18:33] with the GT, it has obviously been
[18:35] approved and will then be
[18:37] able to be modified very flexibly. Similar
[18:39] to Audi, by the way, the Q8 Etron, which
[18:41] is significantly smaller, is also a
[18:42] recruiter. Now, however, he's in
[18:45] and can tell you anything he
[18:47] wants. Ines, who's in there. Hello, I'm
[18:51] Jessie, and I work in a
[18:53] button factory. I can tell you whatever I
[18:55] want. That's why I'm singing a song
[18:58] about the Kia Eevee 9 GT, but it's
[19:02] not called "new," it's called "no." And that's it
[19:05] for my song. Jessie, were you
[19:07] drinking paint? Was there anything in your coffee this morning
[19:09] ? Maybe here in
[19:10] the workshop. She has I
[19:11] drank a whole pot of coffee this morning. They
[19:13] looked at me strangely, and
[19:15] I said, "No, no, I'll take
[19:16] one pot, and there are four
[19:17] coffees in it." I was like, "Yeah, that's fine,
[19:19] maybe you should leave it for the future
[19:21] ." "So, but hey,
[19:25] we've got it now." "Yeah, let's go."
[19:27] You can adjust everything down there. The
[19:28] top mirrors fold in electrically. See
[19:31] that?
[19:32] Steering wheel heating, massage function,
[19:34] seat cooling, seat heating, and you can
[19:36] save the whole thing. If you
[19:37] press the button twice at the front, the handle opens. The
[19:39] tailgate opens at the back when
[19:41] you
[19:42] stop. It works at the back, right? The space is
[19:45] so small, by the way, I'm not
[19:47] sure. Look, you can see
[19:48] how it goes up or down
[19:51] . I wasn't sure if we
[19:53] could film today, but since you
[19:57] 're obviously a grand master of your craft, much like Picasso, it
[19:59] worked out well. It's the
[20:00] coffee. Not the coffee. Yes,
[20:03] I had coffee floating through here.
[20:05] Coffee. The steering wheel is electric.
[20:07] Adjustable.
[20:08] The driving modes are down there. Perforated
[20:11] area, 12 o'clock mark in neon green,
[20:14] and what does GT mean? Gran Turismo. Mega.
[20:18] Look up there. Now you can
[20:20] press it, and then you have GT mode or the
[20:21] MyDrive modes. There are also
[20:23] various driving modes. What do
[20:25] we think of the animation?
[20:28] Not as crazy as Hyundai's now.
[20:29] They always do a fire show like
[20:31] Dragon Ball Z. I think that's
[20:32] cooler. And what happens here—I do
[20:34] n't know if it's happened to you too—is
[20:35] that the cheeks grip a bit.
[20:37] Kia is in the logo here, and you
[20:39] can also
[20:41] tumble through the various
[20:43] graphics at the front and then you can also
[20:45] distribute the power here somehow. Up there is
[20:48] a huge head-up display. Look at
[20:50] the column there, everything covered,
[20:52] really powerful. Then you have the
[20:54] gear selector here in the middle.
[20:56] You can turn it on and off. That's good because it
[21:00] frees up space in the middle. Different
[21:02] recuperation levels on the steering wheel, you can see
[21:04] them here. And now let's talk.
[21:06] About the infotainment. First of all, I
[21:08] really like that there's a separate
[21:10] climate control here, and then should we
[21:14] start with the charging planning? Yes,
[21:15] let's do it. Maybe to
[21:19] Munich. Munich. Why not Berlin?
[21:22] Um, it's too close, right? Munich,
[21:26] Ludwig, Munich Central Station. Nope. Yes, let's
[21:29] just do Munich. You have to
[21:30] add a bit of variety
[21:32] to the videos, I'd say, right?
[21:34] Yes, but this one only has
[21:35] 14% left here. Am I seeing that right? Mhm.
[21:38] Okay. A car has a maximum range of about 550 km
[21:42] . This one has a range of 450 km
[21:44] . Considering it has so much
[21:46] power, I don't think it's that
[21:47] bad. Of course, power always affects
[21:49] the range a bit.
[21:52] I'm surprised that more haven't
[21:56] opted for rear-wheel drive with a large battery. By the way, let's be
[21:57] clear: the charging time is 24 minutes, and
[21:59] now look here, it does the
[22:01] charging planning itself. That's really
[22:03] good. You can see that the charging station is
[22:05] started and then somehow scale.
[22:07] You can see how much
[22:09] Percent, I think that you also
[22:10] want to arrive at your destination. You can then
[22:13] just show the charging station, for example,
[22:15] which is a great system.
[22:17] Then you don't have to work with an app
[22:19] or anything like that. There you have the
[22:20] card. Here we always go
[22:23] back. Then you have everything about
[22:25] electric cars, for example,
[22:28] you can plan charging here and things like that. You will then
[22:30] also see the consumption and things like that.
[22:33] Ipadle Plug and Charge is also new
[22:35] in cars. Intelligent recuperation,
[22:38] you can then adjust everything and then
[22:41] you can also take the time. So,
[22:42] if you really want to go on the
[22:43] Nordschleife with this, it would also be a
[22:45] practical function that is included
[22:46] . Apple cable, Android Auto is available.
[22:49] Everything about the seats can be
[22:51] adjusted here. Heating, ventilation, and all
[22:54] for a Kia. That's really crazy. There
[22:56] is a washing mode. The weather,
[22:58] you know that from Kia by now, or that
[22:59] you can have the weather shown to you. It
[23:01] 's raining today. Yes, that's really good
[23:03] and that's basically it. Have I
[23:06] forgotten something? FingerScreen. So,
[23:09] there's also touch, which I think you
[23:12] can use your finger to get in there, and the digital
[23:14] mirror at the top. I'm not a big fan of that,
[23:16] but I am, are you hungry? Yes, I'm
[23:20] hungry. Or is the coffee that
[23:23] comes. Oh dear, no, I'm going to eat a
[23:26] croissant now and then J will ask you another question
[23:27] . Now we have praised so much.
[23:30] I feel a little bad because
[23:31] we have to criticize something. I
[23:32] have something to criticize. So
[23:34] the car is too big for me for everyday use. Well, that's not
[23:37] true of course, but I've already driven it in
[23:39] everyday life
[23:41] and it's really big.
[23:42] But it's like when you go to a pet shop and
[23:47] buy a, I don't know, Great Dane and then bring it
[23:49] back after two weeks and say,
[23:51] I was actually happy with
[23:52] the dog, but it was too big for me and it also
[23:54] laid a bit too big a pile.
[23:57] Speaking of piles, cars are only bought by
[24:00] people who need a big car
[24:02] because they want space, or
[24:04] people like the pilot in our village, who
[24:08] we would really like to
[24:09] visit because he has a
[24:10] beautiful
[24:12] Hiesl Horaus with somehow and he
[24:15] plants bonsai trees as a hobby
[24:17] with his husband and he needs a
[24:19] big car because he has to
[24:20] transport the bonsai trees and he would
[24:23] rather drive that than something more expensive. I
[24:25] also have to take the green cuttings
[24:26] away to Samstack. Yes, but we wouldn't
[24:28] take the car, we would take a
[24:29] longer trip. Oh, I forgot that. It
[24:31] pulls up to
[24:33] 1.8 to 2.5 tons and that is of course
[24:38] really good for Bonser trees, for
[24:39] green waste and for Danish conclusion. Yes,
[24:44] Kia turns the world upside down, because
[24:48] I deliberately dropped the introduction
[24:51] . Is it the best Kia?
[24:55] any times.
[24:57] Of course you're wondering if this guy will fit under the
[25:01] car? Not
[25:03] really. I think I've always wanted to
[25:05] do something like that. Now we're going to do
[25:07] the whole conclusion lying down, I'd
[25:10] say.
[25:11] So, let’s talk about the
[25:18] Korean flagship. And now Hyundai and
[25:21] Kia, or rather the parent company, have
[25:24] launched the premium brand Genesis,
[25:27] and many people thought that it would
[25:29] be even more successful in Germany
[25:31] and that it would take a lot of customers away from Mercedes, BMW, and Audi
[25:34] . Why
[25:37] might it not be as successful as
[25:39] expected? I think that's also because
[25:40] Hyundai and Kia are so good that it
[25:44] might not even be
[25:49] possible to establish a premium brand above them, if you look at this one.
[25:51] Luxury electro performance SUV.
[25:54] This is the best Kia ever. And
[25:57] now you might have to
[25:59] look at the platform first, while others
[26:01] like Mercedes build on a 400 volt
[26:03] platform and are significantly more expensive.
[26:07] Zack, here's something like Hold my
[26:11] Korean Reich liquor. Why? We
[26:14] have 800 volts. Even with this one, we
[26:17] now have an output of 508 hp, and
[26:19] even though it's really heavy, like almost
[26:21] every
[26:22] electric car, it goes to 100 in 4.6 seconds.
[26:25] And all at a price that I'll
[26:28] tell you at the end: really affordable
[26:29] . The look, I think, is just
[26:36] a bit more to my taste with its angular design than that of the
[26:37] Hyundai Ionic 9. On the other hand, the
[26:40] Ionic 9 is even more
[26:43] special. So, interior, great
[26:46] quality, great technology, over the air
[26:48] updates, plenty of space in the back. It's available
[26:50] as a six-seater or a seven-seater, and to
[26:53] be honest, that's quite a package,
[26:55] which I think is really good in conjunction
[26:56] with, do you know how much of a warranty Kia
[26:59] offers? 8 years 7 years
[27:02] manufacturer's warranty. But how much does it cost
[27:04] now? Where do you think it starts?
[27:06] At 90. It starts at €62,000 and
[27:12] then I told you that
[27:13] most of the customers, which
[27:14] surprised me, go for all-wheel drive, although it's
[27:16] not really his SUV, right, and that's
[27:18] just under €70,000 if
[27:20] it has all-wheel drive. All-wheel drive and GTIN, so with
[27:24] 385 hp, where do we think it starts
[27:26] ?
[27:28] 80 at €82,000. And I don’t know how much it will cost
[27:33] yet.
[27:34] However, I know that it will
[27:36] come onto the market in the third quarter of 2024 and I
[27:38] know that it will be under €100,000
[27:41] because the Kia EV6 GT currently starts at
[27:43] under €70, because with the facelift you get
[27:45] the
[27:48] 0.25% company car tax subsidy and
[27:51] the new federal government will
[27:53] also increase the subsidy by €100,000.
[27:54] That's why he's like this: you've
[27:56] landed here on the channel that actually
[27:58] never should have
[27:59] wanted to become a tax advisor and never did
[28:01] . The Carash Review.
[28:04] Every day you'll get a video from
[28:05] Steuerfüchs and Jessie at 5 p.m. or
[28:08] from me.
