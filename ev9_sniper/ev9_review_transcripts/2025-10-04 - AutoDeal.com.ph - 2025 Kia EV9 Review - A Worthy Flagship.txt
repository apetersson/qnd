[00:02] The definition of flagship is a vessel
[00:05] that carries the commander of the fleet.
[00:06] Now the word can also be used to
[00:09] describe the largest and the finest in a
[00:11] group of things like let's say for
[00:12] example in a product lineup. This ladies
[00:14] and gentlemen is the Kia EV9 GT line.
[00:17] And this is the quintessential
[00:19] definition of a flagship. It's big, it's
[00:22] quick, it's got a long range. And it's
[00:25] got an extensive list of features that
[00:27] you would not believe, which include a
[00:30] pair of captain seats in the second row
[00:32] that not only recline with an ottoman,
[00:35] but it's also got a massage function. So
[00:37] good, in fact, it'll make you rethink
[00:39] your mattress at home. Speaking of
[00:41] which, you've got to meet the allnew CD
[00:43] postropedic adjustable bed system. Now
[00:45] with ice touch technology, available in
[00:47] soft and firm feels paired with the
[00:49] adjustable bed frame. Celia has over 140
[00:51] years of experience creating and
[00:52] innovating mattresses and is now the
[00:54] number one mattress brand in Singapore,
[00:56] Australia, and the US. And thanks to
[00:57] Focus Global, Celi is also made
[00:59] available here in the Philippines.

[01:02] perfect angle for reading, relaxing, or
[01:04] drifting off to sleep. With Celi

[01:25] of the wives. It gently lifts your head
[01:28] to provide targeted support and help
[01:29] reduce the wookie inside
[01:32] you. And for movie nights or just
[01:34] binging the auto deal YouTube channel,
[01:36] there's a TV position that keeps you
[01:38] perfectly propped up to prevent neck and
[01:40] back strain. Discover the ultimate sleep
[01:41] experience tailored to you at the touch

[01:45] to enjoy your side of the mattress the
[01:46] way you want it and the way your partner
[01:48] wants it down to the position and
[01:50] mattress type. The CD postropedic
[01:52] adjustable bed system starts at 464,000
[01:55] Philippine pesos for a queen, assuming
[01:57] you spend an average of 6 to8 hours a
[01:59] day in bed. It's worth it. Celi also has
[02:02] a wide range of premium hotel and
[02:03] orthopedic mattresses from extra soft to
[02:05] extra firm. Visit Celi at Shangoda Plaza
[02:08] or at any of these stores near you. Take

[02:12] into a VIP experience right from the
[02:14] comfort of your own
[02:16] home. Now, a big car requires big power,
[02:20] and boyo does it have it. It's got twin
[02:23] motors, meaning it's an all-wheel drive
[02:25] system, and that produces a whopping 378
[02:28] horses and a staggering 700 new me of
[02:32] torque, all stemming from a 99.8 kWh
[02:36] battery. Now, the range is claimed to be
[02:38] 505 kilometers, which is pretty darn
[02:41] good considering the size of the
[02:42] vehicle. Now, on to charging. If you
[02:44] have an 11 kW charger, then it'll take
[02:47] you roughly about 10 hours to go from
[02:50] 10% to 100%. Which is not really bad.
[02:53] You get home and you charge it. However,
[02:55] it is capable of going from 10 to 80% in
[02:59] just 24 minutes if you have a 350 kW
[03:03] charger, which from my knowledge there
[03:06] isn't one available in the country as of
[03:08] yet, unless you get a couple of jumper
[03:11] cables and you hack the grid directly.
[03:14] large and imposing front clip. Huge
[03:17] 21inch wheel standing on a surprisingly
[03:20] modest 177 millimeters of ground
[03:22] clearance. Black accents around the
[03:24] edges of the car give it a bolder look
[03:26] and its overall profile is very classic
[03:29] boxy SUV, but the star map lights give
[03:32] it a very futuristic look. As with most
[03:36] EVs, you have a frunk. And in the case
[03:38] of the EV9, you've got one that is 52 L.
[03:41] quite large, quite useful, especially
[03:43] since it fits this bag that holds your
[03:46] mobile charger and of course your V2L
[03:49] adapter, which is very, very nice,
[03:51] especially when you're camping like
[03:52] this. Wow, camping me. Yeah, right. My
[03:56] idea of camping is room service. Cargo
[04:00] space at the rear ain't too shabby
[04:03] either. Mm. Open her up and you are
[04:06] looking at a decent 333 liters of space
[04:10] which by the way is really cool because
[04:13] underneath is where you can hide the
[04:15] toe. I wish more cars did that. So
[04:18] definitely big enough for the overnight.
[04:20] But I think you could fit even
[04:22] ridiculously sized full-size Malleta in
[04:24] here which by the way if you'd like to
[04:26] see we actually have a video of taking
[04:29] that Malleta out on a drive. We'll put
[04:30] the link somewhere down below. But
[04:32] anyway, 333 L of space. And not just the
[04:35] space, but you also have a 12volt
[04:36] socket. And then you have a an AC socket
[04:40] as well and buttons to fold the third
[04:43] row and the second row. If you were to
[04:45] fold the third row with a push of a
[04:47] button, then you're looking at over 800
[04:50] L of space. And it's flat, too. So, you
[04:52] can load like buying boxes and push them
[04:54] to the back. No issues there whatsoever.
[04:56] And then a second set of buttons which
[04:58] will electronically push the seats in
[05:00] the second row a little bit forward, but
[05:02] you have to manually fold it flat. And
[05:04] when you do, you're looking at about
[05:07] 2,318 L of space, which is
[05:11] ridiculous. I've never seen captain
[05:13] chairs this fully featured that can fold
[05:15] flat. I don't know, man. That's that's
[05:17] pretty darn impressive right there. It
[05:19] is. You can access the third row by
[05:23] folding this seat. But since there's so
[05:25] much space in this car anyway, look at
[05:27] this. I can even close the door while
[05:30] I'm making my way to the
[05:32] back. So much space. The leg room is not
[05:36] going to be great if the person in front
[05:37] of you is not feeling generous to you. I
[05:39] mean, this is a very generous way of me
[05:41] sitting in the second row behind Jack's
[05:44] driving position, but I can most
[05:46] definitely still move it forward and I'd
[05:47] still have a lot of space to be able to
[05:49] fold my legs. In the case of the third
[05:51] row though, if the second row is quite
[05:53] generous, it's a decent amount of space
[05:55] for the third row. Not much thigh
[05:57] support, even for a shorter person for
[05:59] myself. But I guess smaller kids will
[06:01] really have no qualms by being back here
[06:03] at all because there are cup holders on
[06:06] either side. There's also type-C
[06:08] chargers on either side. And get this,
[06:10] you can also slightly recline your seats
[06:13] ever so gently with a push of a button.
[06:15] But if you are a manchild like myself,
[06:19] ducks, I'm trying to say that I'm
[06:20] actually bigger than I am. The headroom
[06:22] is still quite decent. Look at that. The
[06:25] leg room is a little bit on the tight
[06:27] side. Again, depending on the person in
[06:29] front, but the headroom, look at that.
[06:32] I'm not saying you could fit Bonjing
[06:34] back here, but I don't think it would be
[06:35] an issue to put Jack back here. Oh,
[06:38] Jack.
[06:42] Hey. Yeah, that's not bad. The person
[06:43] that's definitely going to be sitting in
[06:45] front of you has to be a little bit
[06:47] generous. Again, very easy access from
[06:50] the third row onto the second row, which
[06:53] is where you really want to be because
[06:55] it's very, very comfortable. So, first
[06:57] you have a share of the panoramic roof.
[07:00] Not very large, but large enough that
[07:02] the second row and the third row can
[07:03] share. What the third row does not need
[07:05] to share with the second row are air
[07:07] vents. Because while the second row has
[07:08] their own, so does the third row. I
[07:10] forgot to mention that. So, the only
[07:12] thing that's manual inside this second
[07:14] row area would be this uh shade for the
[07:19] window. And then when you actually need
[07:21] to fold the seat flat when you're
[07:23] loading cargo, everything else on this
[07:25] thing is powered and I love it. You've
[07:28] got a power ottoman. You've got a power
[07:30] reclining. You've got power zero gravity
[07:33] and whatnot. Then you've got controls
[07:35] for your massage functions, which is
[07:37] actually very cool. Pop it on and you
[07:40] can have the vibrate onto your upper
[07:41] back and buttocks and then you have a
[07:44] vibrate for your lower back. You can
[07:46] change the intensity. That's awesome.
[07:49] Not only does this have a massage
[07:51] function and an ottoman, but it also is
[07:54] ventilated. You've got other amenities
[07:56] in here like you've got air controls
[07:57] directly up front or rather above. These
[08:00] are not just air controls, but they're
[08:02] actually also temperature controls. Down
[08:04] below, you've got two cup holders. Uh
[08:07] flanking it on either side on the
[08:09] driver's seat and the pass the front
[08:11] passenger are your uh type-C charging
[08:13] points for the for the rear. You've got
[08:15] this huge tray in the center that comes
[08:18] out and then it extends as a table,
[08:21] which by the way underneath is so big
[08:23] that it can house Jack's ridiculously
[08:25] sized bottle, which is very, very nice.
[08:29] And then of course all the power
[08:30] features that you have on your seats and
[08:33] also are equipped with ISOIX tethers so
[08:35] it's nice and safe. There's also ball
[08:36] holders on either side and then you have
[08:39] meridian speakers inside this car which
[08:42] actually sound pretty darn good. The
[08:44] best part, the absolute best part about
[08:46] this though has got to be when you're
[08:47] being driven around because it is just a
[08:50] joy man. Pop open the
[08:54] ottoman. Let's move back a little bit
[08:56] more. Recline some more and then turn
[09:00] the massage function
[09:02] on. Yes, darling.
[09:06] [Music]
[09:14] We Okay, so the front seats, lots of
[09:18] cool tech uh things in here. So, let's
[09:21] start from the top and work our way
[09:22] down. Okay, so obviously you have your
[09:24] sunroof for the front two passengers.
[09:27] This mirror right here is not just your
[09:28] average mirror. Let's say, for example,
[09:30] you have passengers in the back and you
[09:32] don't want an impeded view of the rear.
[09:34] Just flip the switch and the camera at
[09:36] the rear turns on, turning this into
[09:38] essentially a screen. The next set of
[09:41] screens would be something that I first
[09:43] saw in the Soul Mobility Show back in
[09:45] 2023, which I hoped that they were going
[09:48] to keep, which are the side mirrors.
[09:50] These screens for the side mirrors, and
[09:51] they did. It's here in the country. So,
[09:53] it's obviously not a side mirror. It's
[09:55] or rather a mirror. It's a camera. So,
[09:57] you've got cameras outside that display
[09:59] the image on these screens inside. Now,
[10:01] this is actually very cool tech. The
[10:04] problem is is that it might take some
[10:07] getting used to because well, since it's
[10:11] an image, there's no depth perception.
[10:13] That's one. Second, you know that
[10:15] feeling when you're trying to look at a
[10:16] mirror and you kind of angle yourself to
[10:19] sort of like change the view. Yeah.
[10:20] Obviously, you can't do that here. What
[10:22] you see is what you get. For the most
[10:24] part of using this vehicle, it's
[10:26] actually pretty cool cuz it's it's
[10:28] high-tech really. It just does take some
[10:30] getting used to. Um, if you're wondering
[10:32] if it creates any blind spots, maybe a
[10:35] small one, but nothing larger than your
[10:37] average full-size mirror would have
[10:39] caused. Anyway, to continue with the
[10:41] screens, more screens, there are two
[10:43] 12.3 in screens directly in front of
[10:45] you. One as your um infotainment center
[10:49] and the other as your instrument
[10:51] cluster. Now, the infotainment obviously
[10:53] is going to be touchscreen as it is, and
[10:55] it does have Apple CarPlay and Android
[10:56] Auto. And of course, it has a 360
[10:58] camera. Why wouldn't it? There's so many
[11:00] cameras inside this car. Anyway, getting
[11:01] into the proper driving position is
[11:03] very, very easy since it's fully
[11:04] powered. There's memory function, too.
[11:06] And these seats are actually cool seats
[11:08] and warm seats as well. And not to be
[11:11] outdone by the second row, but the
[11:14] driver also gets a massage function.
[11:16] Yes, why wouldn't he? He's the king.
[11:19] steering wheel. Somewhat flat on top,
[11:21] kind of round on the bottom. It is a
[11:23] chunky steering wheel. It's a lot
[11:25] thicker than other steering wheels. Um,
[11:28] which is not necessarily a bad thing
[11:30] because it just means that there's a lot
[11:32] more to grab onto. Kind of like Jack. A
[11:35] thanks, man. Um, it feels good to the
[11:38] touch like Jack. We're going to stop
[11:40] there. I'm sorry. We're going to stop.
[11:41] We're going to pause there. We're going
[11:42] to edit that. What we noticed is that
[11:44] the steering is very, very light when
[11:46] you're trying to maneuver during
[11:47] traffic. It's super super light.
[11:49] Obviously, it's electronic steering, but
[11:50] it tightens up nicely when you go out
[11:52] for a drive, which we'll discuss a
[11:53] little bit later. On the left, you have
[11:55] your cruise functions. On the right, you
[11:57] have your audio controls. And down
[11:58] below, you have your terrain mode and
[12:00] your drive modes as well. At the back,
[12:03] you've got two paddles. They are
[12:05] obviously not for gears. It's for your
[12:07] regeneration. It's sort of like um
[12:09] allows you more regen and less regen
[12:11] depending on how you drive. In the
[12:13] center, you've got buttons on this pad
[12:16] right here. Well, it's not a pad. that
[12:17] it's a panel really. Uh these uh buttons
[12:20] go straight into your infotainment, get
[12:22] to your home, your map, your media, and
[12:24] so on and so forth. But there are
[12:26] physical controls for your audio and
[12:28] your air, which Jack absolutely loves
[12:29] cuz you can get to them very, very
[12:31] quickly. I turned off the air. Below
[12:33] that, you have your charging points, two
[12:36] type-C's, and a 12vt socket, which is
[12:38] pretty cool cuz the door, check this
[12:40] out. The door isn't a flip, it's a push.
[12:44] Oh, that's nice. Lots of storage space
[12:48] inside this car. Underneath enough space
[12:51] to fit Earl's ridiculously sized bottle.
[12:54] Am I the only one that doesn't have a
[12:55] ridiculously sized bottle? Here in the
[12:58] center, lots of cubby room. Uh you push
[13:01] these and boom, turns out to be cup
[13:04] holders. A wireless charging pad here in
[13:06] the center and then more space here in
[13:09] the middle including the key. And then
[13:12] the last piece of tech is that you have
[13:15] a heads up display which is fully
[13:17] colored by the way. And what Jack tells
[13:19] me is that now you have no excuse for
[13:21] speeding. We are going to go out for a
[13:24] drive and tell you what the EV9 feels
[13:27] like out on the road. But before we do,
[13:29] do please consider subscribing to our
[13:30] channel because we create all of these
[13:32] videos to pay for Gino's trip to Turkey.
[13:35] Why? You know why.
[13:40] And we are here at Istanbul, Turkey to
[13:43] find out a little bit more about their
[13:44] new sport bike, the 450
[13:47] [Music]
[13:50] [Applause]
[13:52] [Music]
[13:57] SR. A car this big has no business being
[14:03] so quick, and yet it is. It can do zero
[14:07] to 100 km/h in just 5.3 seconds. And
[14:11] that spells for absolutely, and I do
[14:14] mean this, effortless driving because of
[14:16] the amount of power that you have, the
[14:19] amount of torque that you have.
[14:21] Overtaking, no problem whatsoever.
[14:24] Overtaking on an incline, good grief, no
[14:27] problems also whatsoever. And since it's
[14:29] electric, then going up twisties,
[14:32] there's just no second guessing of the
[14:33] gears. There's no shifting. There's no
[14:36] popping or waiting for the turbo.
[14:38] Nothing. It just you plant your foot and
[14:40] it just keeps going and going and
[14:43] going. And with that is also the
[14:46] smoothness of the vehicle. Obviously,
[14:48] because it's an EV, there's no gears or
[14:50] anything. It's just very, very smooth,
[14:53] very, very quiet, very calm in here.
[14:57] Even though that this thing is rolling
[14:58] on 21s, the suspension is great. It's
[15:02] not an executive sedan. No, but it's
[15:05] still very comfortable in here. And the
[15:08] steering, I know I touched on this
[15:10] earlier and I did say that we were going
[15:12] to discuss it now. The steering is very,
[15:15] very light. It's as if you're driving
[15:18] this huge vehicle in tiny streets of
[15:21] Metro Manila. And it's so easy cuz the
[15:23] steering is so light. And yet, when
[15:24] you're on the highway, it stiffens up
[15:26] just right so that you feel very, very
[15:29] much in control.
[15:31] You'd expect a lot of technology in here
[15:33] considering that the side mirrors are
[15:35] screens, right? And there are. There's a
[15:36] lot of advanced driver assist systems
[15:39] inside this car and they work really,
[15:40] really great. I'm actually impressed
[15:42] with the adaptive cruise in this car.
[15:44] You guys know that I'm not a fan of
[15:46] adaptive cruise. And yet here it works
[15:48] really, really well. Although you have
[15:49] 700 new meters of torque inside this
[15:51] car, when a car in front of you departs
[15:54] the lane and you have uh free range to
[15:56] go forward, it doesn't pull immediately.
[15:59] It's a slow progression because well, it
[16:02] doesn't want to bury you in your seat.
[16:04] The The one thing that's a little OA is
[16:08] the lane keep assist where it gets kind
[16:11] of swayy a little bit, especially uh in
[16:16] areas where the lines on the road aren't
[16:18] painted very well, like for instance
[16:20] skyway. So every once in a while it's
[16:23] like and then also in addition to the
[16:26] cruise control if let's say for example
[16:29] the adaptive cruise isn't accelerating
[16:32] quick enough for you worry not you just
[16:34] go into the menu and you just tell the
[16:36] car to accelerate faster uh the reaction
[16:38] speed to be slower or faster and
[16:40] whatnot. You can customize it to your
[16:42] liking. This is probably the very first
[16:44] adaptive cruise control that I'm going
[16:46] to say yes to. Wow. Generally the cabin
[16:50] is very very comfortable. So I can
[16:52] imagine myself being driven by Jack uh
[16:55] sitting in the second row enjoying it
[16:57] because it's dark, it's cool, there's
[16:59] shades, there's the massage function for
[17:01] the seats, uh it recines, you can go
[17:03] into zero gravity that that um that
[17:07] angle. But I don't know, it's like the
[17:10] other Kia products. They're very very
[17:12] comfortable and you want to sit in the
[17:13] back. here in this particular product. I
[17:15] want to drive it because it's it's very
[17:18] engaging and it's very sharp and it's
[17:22] just a lot of fun to drive. It could be
[17:24] because of its smooth drivetrain or the
[17:27] powerful motor, the amount of torque and
[17:29] horsepower that you get, um the smooth
[17:32] suspension, but it's really it's just
[17:34] because I feel like this car is very
[17:36] very engaging for the driver. And I like
[17:38] being in this driving position, even
[17:40] though I know that it's probably nicer
[17:43] to sleep in the back. No, sorry, Jack. I
[17:46] don't care what you say. I'm going to
[17:47] bogart this car from
[17:49] you. I don't care. But Nope. I'm really,
[17:53] really enjoying driving this thing. Even
[17:55] though I know I could be snoring in the
[17:57] back, huh? Nope. Okay. It's fun. Wait,
[18:00] wait, wait. That's a word that I don't
[18:02] know. What? What's of when it's a verb?
[18:04] What does bogart mean? like you're
[18:07] making it swapang all to yourself. To
[18:10] acquire the leader of the fleet requires
[18:13] top dollar because the EV9 comes in at
[18:17] 5,938,000 Philippine pesos. It's a true
[18:21] flagship. Don't get me wrong, because
[18:23] it's got a buttload of features and
[18:26] tech. The interior is spacious and just
[18:29] really wonderful. And it is wickedly
[18:31] quick and it has a dynamic drive. Now, I
[18:36] understand that the price may not be for
[18:38] everyone, and that's okay because not
[18:41] everyone is doing
[18:43] this. Not even the Japanese.
