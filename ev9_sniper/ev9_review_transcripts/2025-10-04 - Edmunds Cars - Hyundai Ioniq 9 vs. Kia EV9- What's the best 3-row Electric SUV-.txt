[00:00] SPEAKER: We've given this thing not one, not two,
[00:03] but three Edmunds Top Rated awards.
[00:05] But today it might lose.
[00:08] This is the Kia EV9, one of our favorite electric three-row
[00:11] SUVs.
[00:12] And it's racked up win after win,
[00:14] including at Edmunds Top Rated Best of the Best award
[00:18] that we give to the best vehicle of each year.
[00:21] We also owned one for a year for our year-long road test fleet,
[00:25] and we loved every single second of it.
[00:28] Now, Hyundai and Kia, they're actually
[00:30] owned by the same parent company in Korea.
[00:33] So this brand spankin' new Hyundai IONIQ 9 has a lot
[00:36] in common with the EV9.
[00:38] However, Hyundai has had a few extra years
[00:41] to work out the kinks, and you got to check out
[00:43] what they came up with.
[00:44] You know the drill by now.
[00:46] We're going to go over these interiors,
[00:48] talk tech, tell you how they drive, and measure cargo space.
[00:51] And of course, we'll tell you how each of them
[00:53] did on the world-famous Edmunds EV range test.
[00:56] This should be a good one because we've
[00:58] got two great family vehicles on hand today.
[01:02] Are you ready?
[01:04] We're Edmunds, and we test hundreds of cars each year
[01:06] on the road and at our private track so you
[01:09] get the most trusted reviews.
[01:12] If you want to know which car, truck, or SUV is the best,
[01:15] then stick with us.
[01:19] Just in case you forgot, these front seats
[01:26] are particularly comfortable for a couple
[01:28] of reasons, the main one being these fantastic headrests.
[01:32] Still not over these things.
[01:34] I know we've talked about these things in three straight videos
[01:37] now, but how could you not?
[01:40] These mesh-covered head hammocks have
[01:42] impeccable airflow and great support,
[01:44] and they're our gateway to talking
[01:46] about the EV9 interior, which has fantastic design and quality
[01:51] materials to match.
[01:52] The EV9 was an innovator, a design icon,
[01:56] and a fantastic addition to our One-Year Road Test
[01:59] fleet of 20 or so vehicles when it came out in late 2023.
[02:03] And fast forward a few years later,
[02:05] and it's held up incredibly well.
[02:08] Now, up here between the front passengers,
[02:10] you get two pretty large cup holders.
[02:12] And if you don't need to use them,
[02:14] they'll even fold away so that you
[02:16] get a nicely sized storage bin.
[02:18] Now, down here in front, another storage
[02:20] bin that's kind of hard to access when you're driving,
[02:22] but it's actually a great place to put a small bag or a purse.
[02:26] The center console is pretty small,
[02:28] but that is for a good reason, and we'll
[02:30] show you why in a second.
[02:32] It looks good in here too.
[02:34] This is Kia's most expensive product,
[02:36] and they've pulled out all the tricks.
[02:38] This is the best that they've done when it comes to design.
[02:41] All the touchpoints feel great.
[02:43] This is a high-quality interior, something that you might not
[02:46] expect from Kia.
[02:47] Matching the number of awards this thing has received,
[02:50] you're also getting one, two, three screens up front,
[02:53] and we really like two of them.
[02:55] The instrument cluster is great, just customizable enough.
[02:59] And this other screen, high resolution, easy to reach,
[03:02] and you're getting wireless Android Auto and Apple
[03:04] CarPlay, of course.
[03:06] It's this third screen that is the issue.
[03:08] This houses many of the climate controls,
[03:10] and there's nothing inherently wrong with it itself.
[03:13] The problem is that it's blocked out by the steering wheel,
[03:16] so if you're driving, you can actually see most of it.
[03:18] And to use it, you kind of got to lean over
[03:20] here to get a good look at it.
[03:23] Kia struck a great balance between physical and touch
[03:26] controls on this interior.
[03:28] Right below the screen here, you actually
[03:29] get some very helpful controls, like a Home button or a Media
[03:32] button, because getting out of Android Auto or Apple CarPlay
[03:35] can often be annoying.
[03:36] Instead, you just hit this button here,
[03:38] and even though it's touch sensitive,
[03:39] you can actually hear and feel when you touch it.
[03:42] So we don't hate it that much.
[03:43] Now, a lot of the things that you're not
[03:45] going to use very often, like the driver assistance settings,
[03:47] for example, they're about a menu deep.
[03:50] But all the stuff that you're going to use a lot,
[03:52] you get a physical control for, including
[03:55] one of my favorite features, a surround-view camera button.
[03:58] So can turn that on whenever you need it.
[04:00] Now, instead of a volume knob, you
[04:02] are getting a volume roller thingy, which we don't love.
[04:05] And the only reason we're bringing that up
[04:06] is because on an interior this good,
[04:08] we're going to have to nitpick to find things
[04:11] that we don't love.
[04:12] This is good but not great, like the rest of these controls are.
[04:15] And the buttons on the steering wheel, they're great as well.
[04:18] They're not too small, so they're actually
[04:20] pretty easy to hit.
[04:21] The only thing that we wish for is this customizable button,
[04:23] if you had a few more options for it.
[04:25] And other ones in there, we really liked.
[04:27] Beyond the headrest, the seats themselves
[04:29] are also mega comfortable, plenty of adjustments
[04:32] so you can find a great seating position with strong heating
[04:35] and ventilation too.
[04:37] And they even have a relaxation mode,
[04:39] so you can kick back and put your feet up,
[04:41] whether you're waiting for a charge or soccer practice
[04:44] to end.
[04:44] And by the way, you can do that in the second row as well.
[04:48] Oh, and while I'm relaxing, I love
[04:50] to find out what car prices are at local dealers near me,
[04:53] or check out what my current set of wheels is worth.
[04:56] And you can do all of that at our site.
[04:58] That's right.
[04:59] You're also getting those fancy relaxation seats here
[05:02] in the second row, and they also come with power adjustments.
[05:06] And if you go above anything but the base trim,
[05:08] you're also getting seat heating and ventilation
[05:11] in these captain's chairs.
[05:13] These chairs are better equipped than the front seats
[05:16] in many, many other vehicles.
[05:18] And that is awesome.
[05:19] And as you can also tell, plenty of legroom and headroom
[05:22] and forward and back adjustments, so you
[05:24] can get some legroom to your friends in the third row
[05:26] as well.
[05:27] Now, these headrests, super comfortable.
[05:29] I still think the meshy ones are better,
[05:31] but these are almost as good because you
[05:33] can reach up and tug them forward like this,
[05:35] like you would on an airplane.
[05:37] And that makes this even better to nap in.
[05:40] And remember that very small center console?
[05:42] Well, that's because the underneath space
[05:44] is taken up by this.
[05:45] It's a pretty large storage bin for second-row passengers,
[05:48] and it even comes with this nice rubberized surface
[05:51] that you can use as a table.
[05:52] And you've got plenty of space down here for all
[05:55] of your favorite snacks.
[05:58] And if you plan on putting little ones here
[06:00] in the second or third rows, good news.
[06:03] There are easily accessible lower
[06:04] and upper latch anchors on every seat and plenty of room here
[06:08] to fit even a rear-facing car seat, though in the third row,
[06:11] you might have a bit more trouble negotiating a seat back
[06:14] there.
[06:15] Speaking of getting in the third row, that's also super easy.
[06:18] You've got a button that you can press right on top here
[06:21] or even one you can press down low,
[06:22] and the seat will move forward out of the way.
[06:25] And we really like this because even little kids can operate it
[06:28] without any trouble.
[06:29] Now, would I rather be sitting in the second row?
[06:31] Probably.
[06:32] But things are still pretty great back here.
[06:35] I've got an air vent.
[06:35] I've got cup holders.
[06:37] I've got USB charging ports on both sides.
[06:39] And when we own one of these, we packed
[06:41] it full of six adults pretty frequently with few complaints.
[06:45] As far as third rows go, this is pretty great.
[06:48] Behind the third row, you get just over 20 cubic feet
[06:51] of cargo space.
[06:52] But as you can see, that was just enough
[06:54] for us to fit two of our bags.
[06:56] The third one is going to have to get strapped down
[06:58] on the roof, and that's the problem with these midsize
[07:01] three=row SUVs.
[07:02] If you're going to fill in with people,
[07:03] there's not a ton of space for cargo.
[07:06] Now, where the EV9 does have a slight advantage
[07:08] over the IONIQ 9 is an underfloor storage.
[07:11] You can actually fit the cargo cover down here,
[07:13] so you can bring it with you instead
[07:15] of having to leave it behind in the garage.
[07:17] And you're also getting a household outlet back here,
[07:20] so there are some features.
[07:21] But this third row is manual folding, not powered,
[07:24] although the second row, you just hit buttons,
[07:26] and those seats will fall down for you.
[07:28] Now, both of these vehicles also have frunks,
[07:30] but they're not really big enough to be useful.
[07:32] They're good for storing charging cables or something
[07:34] like that, but not much else.
[07:36] Now, there is one thing about this cargo area
[07:38] that I don't really like.
[07:39] And they have this sort of carpeted covering
[07:41] that they Velcro onto the back of the third row
[07:44] and onto the floor here, but it gets all bunched up
[07:46] when these seats are up.
[07:47] And it looks very unsightly.
[07:49] It's the kind of thing that I would just rip out.
[07:54] Range and charging are both good here in the EV9,
[07:57] but what we want to talk to you about right
[07:58] now is how it drives.
[08:00] And in a word, it's excellent.
[08:02] Here in the GT-Line, you've got plenty of power
[08:05] for accelerating uphill, passing and merging,
[08:08] even if the thing is full of people and all of their stuff.
[08:12] The only thing to watch out for is
[08:13] if you go for one of these single-motor versions
[08:15] of the EV9, it's definitely going
[08:17] to feel taxed because this is a lot of vehicle to move
[08:20] for a single motor.
[08:21] But personally, my favorite part is its suspension tuning.
[08:25] It toes the line between comfort and agility
[08:28] pretty much perfectly.
[08:30] There's enough compliance so that bumps in the road
[08:32] won't upset the cabin, and the ride
[08:33] stays comfortable in day-to-day driving,
[08:36] but it's taut enough to feel athletic.
[08:38] And for a big vehicle, the EV9 hides its weight really well.
[08:42] And as a bonus, at our test track,
[08:44] we noticed that the EV9 is very stable under hard braking.
[08:48] And it's also got a one-pedal driving mode
[08:50] that's very easy to modulate and still
[08:52] drive the vehicle smoothly.
[08:54] I also personally like that you can
[08:56] go between the different region settings with the paddles
[08:58] here on the wheel, and you don't have
[09:00] to dig into any of the menus.
[09:01] One thing about the EV9 that doesn't get enough attention
[09:03] is that it has excellent visibility.
[09:05] You've got these giant windows all around you,
[09:08] so it's easy to see out of in every direction.
[09:10] And then backing that up, you're also
[09:12] getting a great surround-view camera system and a blind spot
[09:15] monitor system here in the cluster.
[09:17] So if I activate the turn signal,
[09:19] it shows a live view of the blind spot
[09:21] right here where I can see it.
[09:22] Now, the EV9 isn't going to offer a hands-free highway
[09:25] driving mode like you're going to get in some vehicles
[09:28] from Ford and GM, but what's here is pretty great.
[09:32] The system can do automatic lane changes for you,
[09:35] and on the highway, it tracks super straight in the lane keep.
[09:38] No complaints about that either.
[09:40] So to wrap things up, the interior
[09:42] is comfortable and really well appointed.
[09:44] It's great to drive.
[09:46] We like the tech.
[09:47] There's plenty of cargo area.
[09:48] Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[09:49] This thing is awesome.
[09:52] Now let's see what the Hyundai has up its sleeve.
[09:59] Now, remember, these two vehicles
[10:01] are very similar when it comes to features.
[10:04] The things you're going to find here in the IONIQ 9,
[10:06] you can, for the most part, also find in the EV9.
[10:09] What we're going to focus on, then,
[10:10] is the differences between these two cabins.
[10:13] That might actually help you make a choice between the two
[10:16] vehicles.
[10:17] Now, the first big difference you're going to notice
[10:19] is design.
[10:20] Hyundai has a different kind of aesthetic.
[10:23] They're a little bit allergic to straight lines.
[10:25] So if you look here on the doors,
[10:26] there's just a lot of ovals and a lot of gentle curves.
[10:29] I like it.
[10:29] It actually gives the cabin some character.
[10:32] But again, styling is more of a personal thing.
[10:35] What is a little bit weird is they
[10:37] have this kind of plastic trim piece right here
[10:39] that's, I think, meant to look like granite.
[10:41] But instead, it just ends up kind
[10:43] of looking a little bit weird.
[10:44] I like that felt trim piece in the EV9 just a touch more.
[10:48] These seats are very similar to the ones you're getting also
[10:50] in the Kia, same relaxation features where you can lean it
[10:53] back and the footrest comes up.
[10:55] Well, they are missing those mesh headrests,
[10:57] but these things, they're still pretty and cushy and
[10:59] comfortable, so not too many complaints there.
[11:02] What is a bit weird, and this is also true of the Kia,
[11:04] is that there is no separate bottom adjustment.
[11:06] So if you want the seat to angle up,
[11:08] it actually moves the whole seat,
[11:09] so you have to do this and then this
[11:11] to get it sort of situated in the way that you want.
[11:13] Materials here in the IONIQ 9 are, for the most part,
[11:16] fantastic.
[11:17] Now, both the Kia and the Hyundai,
[11:19] they do engage some cost cutting,
[11:21] but they both do a great job of hiding it.
[11:23] Everything that you're going to touch regularly feels good.
[11:26] These knobs are rubberized, for example,
[11:28] so they're really easy to grip.
[11:29] And where there is plastic, it's kind of tucked away in ways
[11:32] that you wouldn't notice.
[11:33] But here in the IONIQ 9, there's one thing I really don't like,
[11:36] and it's this spot right here below the screen.
[11:38] Now, when everyone uses a touch screen,
[11:40] you'll naturally put your hand here before just
[11:43] to stabilize yourself before you swipe through things.
[11:45] And this spot, because it's a lighter kind of silvery plastic,
[11:49] it picks up not fingerprints, per se, but oils from your skin.
[11:53] And this part is actually becoming stained.
[11:56] I tried to clean this, and it wouldn't come off.
[11:58] This vehicle only has about 3,000 miles on it,
[12:01] so if you have one for the long haul,
[12:02] that's something you're going to want to watch out for.
[12:04] Now, these two take very different approaches when
[12:06] it comes to small item storage.
[12:08] And I think I like what they do in the Hyundai just a bit more.
[12:12] Here in front of the passenger, you're
[12:13] getting a convenient shelf.
[12:15] And down here, instead of a large bin
[12:16] in front of the console, you're getting
[12:18] two smaller bins that are still great for small items.
[12:21] But having this thing be movable gives it a lot
[12:24] more flexibility, not just for passengers up front, but also
[12:27] in the second row.
[12:28] And that's because this thing can
[12:30] be opened and accessed from the front and from the back as well.
[12:34] Now, these cup holders, you don't get that nice storage bin
[12:36] in the Kia that you could stow away,
[12:38] but they're still plenty big.
[12:39] And as you can see, they fit our big cup and our water bottle
[12:42] just fine.
[12:43] Now, if we're being honest, the bin in the EV9,
[12:45] prohibitively small.
[12:46] But in here it's really big, and you can even
[12:48] take out this divider and reach all the way down in there
[12:52] and fit pretty much anything.
[12:54] Now, if you look at these screens,
[12:55] it's going to look very familiar to what we saw in the Kia.
[12:59] And that's a good thing because we like this system,
[13:01] simple, easy to use.
[13:02] Only two screens up here instead of three,
[13:04] though, because the climate controls live down here
[13:07] where they are a bit easier to see and use.
[13:10] Where these two are a bit different
[13:12] is when it comes to charging.
[13:13] Here in the IONIQ 9, you're getting an extra USB-C port,
[13:16] but what's even cooler is that these things put out
[13:18] a ton of power, 100 watts.
[13:21] And for some reference, that's enough to charge a MacBook Pro.
[13:25] Now that 100 watts is shared throughout the cabin,
[13:27] but if you're charging a laptop, you're
[13:29] probably not charging too many other things,
[13:31] so no worries there.
[13:33] And of course, a wireless charging pad right here.
[13:35] I do like the position of the pad a bit more in the EV9
[13:39] because it's a bit covered.
[13:40] When you have your phone sitting flat like this,
[13:42] if the sun catches it, it's going
[13:43] to bounce up into your eyes, or it's
[13:45] going to make your phone really hot.
[13:47] So having this a bit exposed is not ideal.
[13:50] Because of the IONIQ 9's design, some
[13:51] of the buttons that were here on the EV9
[13:53] have moved to here, including the surround-view camera
[13:55] button, which we really like.
[13:57] But I actually like this because they're even easier to reach.
[14:07] With this console slid into its far back position,
[14:10] storage for second-row passengers is fantastic.
[14:13] We've returned the bin to its normal position
[14:15] to talk about the second row.
[14:17] And just like in the EV9, these seats are absolutely fantastic.
[14:21] They got the foot rest too.
[14:22] They got great headrests, all that stuff.
[14:25] The IONIQ 9, even though it's on the same platform as the EV9,
[14:28] its wheelbase is a couple inches longer,
[14:30] and that does help its cabin to feel a bit more spacious.
[14:34] And I would say that the door openings here in the second row,
[14:37] they feel even a bit larger as well,
[14:39] so it's a touch easier to fit in a car seat.
[14:41] And again, easy access to both the lower and upper
[14:45] latch anchors.
[14:46] And not to sound like a broken record, just like the EV9,
[14:49] heated and ventilated second-row seats, air vents in the ceiling,
[14:53] USB ports easy to access, there.
[14:55] Really, there's nothing more you can ask for out of a second row.
[14:58] There's one other feature that we
[14:59] have to mention because it shows just how much attention Hyundai
[15:02] and Kia pay to these interiors.
[15:04] Now, this armrest, and the EV9 does this as well,
[15:07] you'll hear as I bring it up, it clicks.
[15:09] And each of these clicks is a different position.
[15:11] So whether you're comfortable here or comfortable here,
[15:14] you can find the perfect way to sit here in the second row.
[15:18] There's actually 15 different armrest positions.
[15:21] That is wild.
[15:22] Here in the third row of the Hyundai,
[15:24] you're also getting two USB-C charging ports and cup holders.
[15:28] But there are a few key differences.
[15:30] The first one, that added wheelbase length does give you
[15:33] a touch more legroom, I think.
[15:34] And even though this thing has a sloping roofline,
[15:37] headroom is still great.
[15:38] But the biggest difference is that this
[15:40] is a power reclining third row, so if I want to go back,
[15:43] I just hit this button.
[15:44] And if I go forward, I just hit the other one
[15:47] until I'm comfortable.
[15:48] And the other difference is, if you look up,
[15:51] instead of having a split sunroof,
[15:52] this one has a single panoramic sunroof.
[15:55] And I think I like the approach here
[15:57] in the IONIQ 9 just a bit more.
[15:59] Now, on paper, the IONIQ 9 has two extra cubic feet
[16:02] of cargo space behind its third row.
[16:06] However, because the cargo area is deeper,
[16:08] we were able to fit all three of our bags easily,
[16:11] and that gives the IONIQ 9 functionally more space.
[16:14] Now, back here, you're also going to get a household outlet.
[16:17] But as an added bonus, since all three rows are powered,
[16:20] you can lower the second and third rows
[16:22] at just the touch of a button.
[16:23] And if you're sitting in the driver's seat,
[16:25] you can even do that same thing through the screen.
[16:28] This just makes this cargo area bit more flexible
[16:31] and gives an advantage to the IONIQ 9.
[16:33] I know we've already given you a lot of information
[16:35] on these two vehicles.
[16:37] But if you want even more or on any other new car, truck, or SUV
[16:40] on the road today, head over to Edmunds where you can check out
[16:43] our full ratings and reviews.
[16:50] One member of our test team took the IONIQ 9 home
[16:53] for a few nights, and he summarized
[16:55] it perfectly in his notes, saying that the IONIQ
[16:58] 9 prioritizes comfort while remembering that the road isn't
[17:02] always straight.
[17:03] It's true.
[17:04] This thing rides beautifully.
[17:06] It soaks up bumps, big and small, without any problem,
[17:09] and the cabin always stays very tranquil
[17:12] because this thing also does an excellent job with wind and road
[17:15] noise as well.
[17:17] Now, this is going to sound nitpicky,
[17:18] and that's because it is.
[17:20] And that's what we're going to have
[17:21] to do to find a difference between these two vehicles
[17:24] because they're so close.
[17:25] But for me, the IONIQ 9 suspension, it's just a touch
[17:29] too floaty.
[17:30] There's a bit too much body roll,
[17:31] and it kind of bounces down the road ever so slightly.
[17:34] I prefer the setup in the EV9 because it feels more athletic
[17:39] and just more settled in.
[17:40] Just like in the EV9 though, this thing is super easy
[17:43] to see out of, and it's got all the same great camera
[17:46] systems, including a rear-view camera mirror.
[17:49] The motors are powerful and smooth.
[17:52] This thing actually makes about 40 horsepower more than the EV9,
[17:55] but because it weighs 200 pounds more,
[17:58] it's 0 to 60 time is a tenth slower.
[18:00] But that being said, plenty quick in all circumstances.
[18:04] You're not going to be left wanting for power in either
[18:06] of these vehicles.
[18:08] The braking is also quite smooth,
[18:09] whether you're using the regen or the physical brakes.
[18:12] These things aren't like those Tesla Ubers
[18:14] that you've taken that make you carsick.
[18:16] They are much, much smoother than that thankfully.
[18:19] There is one thing about the IONIQ 9's braking,
[18:21] however, that I don't like, and it
[18:22] happens when you're using the one-pedal drive mode.
[18:25] If you come up to a stop sign or a stop light
[18:27] on any bit of an incline, as the car comes to a stop,
[18:31] it actually rocks back like it's going to start rolling backwards
[18:34] until the brakes grab you.
[18:36] Now, I drove this thing for about a week or so,
[18:38] and unfortunately I never really got used to it
[18:41] because feeling like the vehicle is going to go backwards on you
[18:44] unexpectedly, it never feels good.
[18:46] Now, the IONIQ 9 has the exact same driver aids and technology
[18:50] you're going to find in the EV9.
[18:52] But in our testing, we noted that they
[18:53] don't work quite as well.
[18:55] The lane centering is a bit busier
[18:57] in the adaptive cruise control.
[18:59] It brakes a bit later, which can add some anxiety.
[19:02] But the biggest problem that I have with the IONIQ 9 safety
[19:04] systems is where they put the driver attention monitor.
[19:07] They made the same mistake that Toyota
[19:09] does in some of its vehicles.
[19:10] They put it right here on top of the steering column.
[19:13] So if you're like me and you sometimes
[19:14] like to drive with your hand atop the wheel,
[19:16] it's going to block that sensor completely.
[19:18] And then the system is going to complain
[19:20] that it can't see your face.
[19:22] It is thankfully easier to shut off here in the Hyundai
[19:25] than it is in the Toyotas, but still, this should probably
[19:28] live somewhere else.
[19:29] So does the IONIQ 9 improve on the EV9's formula?
[19:33] In some ways, it certainly does.
[19:35] You get a bit more cargo room, and the cabin is a bit bigger,
[19:38] so this will be better for families, especially
[19:40] those that are going to use the third row often.
[19:43] But it's a very, very tight gap between these two.
[19:47] And it might just come down to what we see in the value
[19:50] and range sections.
[19:51] And now, it's time to share with you the results that both
[19:53] of these vehicles achieved on the Edmunds EV Range
[19:56] and Charging Tests.
[19:58] We've tested over 100 EVs now on our loop,
[20:01] and we do them all the same way, so you can trust our results.
[20:06] Now, even though these two have the exact same platform,
[20:08] they actually have different batteries.
[20:11] The Hyundai's battery is about 10%
[20:13] larger when it comes to capacity,
[20:15] and as you might expect, it also has just over 10% more range.
[20:20] Now, if you want absolute maximum range,
[20:22] both of these vehicles are offered
[20:24] in single-motor versions.
[20:26] That will get you an extra 30 miles or so,
[20:28] but you're going to give up a lot
[20:29] when it comes to performance.
[20:31] Both of these all-wheel drive models, in the 300-mile club,
[20:34] good results there for both.
[20:36] Now, when it comes to charging, these
[20:37] are two of the fastest charging EVs on sale today.
[20:41] The Hyundai, it charges just a little bit quicker.
[20:44] But with both of them, you won't be
[20:45] stuck at a fast charger for a long time.
[20:47] They really put juice back into that battery quickly.
[20:50] And as of 2026, on the EV9, you're
[20:53] going to get an NACS charge port on both of these vehicles,
[20:57] and that will give you access to many of Tesla's supercharger
[21:00] stations.
[21:01] And in case you're wondering what
[21:03] it's like to charge a non-Tesla EV at one of those,
[21:06] we've got a video for that too.
[21:08] The feature that I like that both of these vehicles
[21:10] offer, though, whether you're charging
[21:11] at a supercharger or another third-party fast charger,
[21:15] you can actually pay for it right through the touchscreen.
[21:18] And that gives you greater convenience,
[21:20] no matter which SUV you choose.
[21:22] Before we get into value and share our winner,
[21:25] we just ask you to please toss us a like and subscribe
[21:28] if you've been enjoying our videos.
[21:30] And if you have any questions about these two vehicles
[21:33] or an opinion about which two we should compare next,
[21:35] let us know in the comments below,
[21:37] because for better or worse, we read them all.
[21:39] Now, when it comes to value, there
[21:41] is not a lot separating these two vehicles.
[21:43] They both come with the same gigantic warranties.
[21:46] And if you look at the price tags, there's only a $400
[21:50] difference between the EV9 and the IONIQ 9
[21:52] that we have here today.
[21:54] And as we showed, they have roughly the same feature sets.
[21:57] Now, the IONIQ 9 does have a few added convenience features,
[22:00] like that power-folding third row and the bigger sunroof.
[22:03] And it's got a bit more range, so its value
[22:05] score is just a smidge higher.
[22:07] But I think that the bigger thing
[22:08] that we need to address with these two vehicles
[22:11] is simply how much they cost compared
[22:12] to the rest of the market.
[22:14] It might have seemed crazy back in 2010 to spend
[22:17] in the mid-to-high 70,000s on any Kia or Hyundai,
[22:21] but times have changed.
[22:22] And both of these vehicles have interiors
[22:24] that I think we would call near luxury grade.
[22:28] They both feel worth their price tags from the inside.
[22:31] They both look it from the outside.
[22:33] And compared to the rest of the electric three-row
[22:35] vehicles out there, they seem pretty fairly priced to me.
[22:40] We rate everything about these vehicles on a 10-point scale.
[22:44] A 10 is perfect, a 5 is about average,
[22:46] and a 1, well, that's problematically bad.
[22:50] So after a couple weeks of driving, notetaking, testing,
[22:53] and critiquing these two vehicles, as you can see,
[22:56] they are both pretty much powerhouses across the board.
[23:00] They put up some of the best ratings numbers
[23:02] that we've seen in our system.
[23:04] There are a few gaps, though.
[23:06] The Kia takes the edge when it comes to driving,
[23:08] while the IONIQ 9 wins on range, value, and comfort.
[23:13] As you might expect between these two,
[23:14] it is a very, very close race.
[23:17] And in the end, the Hyundai just barely ekes out
[23:20] a win by only a tenth of a point.
[23:23] While it's a close win for the Hyundai.
[23:25] It's hard to call either of these vehicles a loser.
[23:28] That's how good they both are.
[23:30] If you're going to use the third row often,
[23:32] then yes, you probably want to go with the IONIQ 9
[23:35] and it's a slight bit of extra cargo room.
[23:37] But otherwise, just pick the one that fits your style better,
[23:40] and don't look back.
[23:42] You'll be happy either way, we promise.
[23:44] Lots more videos coming soon, so please stick around.
[23:47] Thanks for watching.
