[00:00] Good day. Welcome to the Automotive Dad
[00:03] and welcome to the 2025
[00:06] Kia EV9.
[00:09] [Music]
[00:18] [Applause]
[00:19] So, what is the EV9? The EV9 is the the
[00:21] flagship, the big boy of Kia's range.
[00:24] 99.7
[00:26] kWh battery. This is a six seat version.
[00:29] So, this is £77,000 on the road. It's
[00:33] powered by two electric motors to give
[00:35] you all-wheel drive, but it's
[00:38] extensively quicker than you might think
[00:40] for its size. So, 378
[00:43] PS, 700 new m of torque, 5.3 to 62, and
[00:48] a top speed of 124 mph. All of this in
[00:51] something the size of a hotel room. But
[00:54] the real question is, is this a an
[00:56] amazing family car? Because with six
[00:59] seaters and a range of 300 miles, this
[01:03] should be really good. So, let's dive in
[01:06] and find out. Now, from the front end,
[01:07] this is bold. It is strong design
[01:09] language, and it's Kia's new design
[01:11] language. It looks good. Big beefy
[01:13] headlights, nice massive grill, a zone
[01:17] where you pick up every single fly that
[01:19] you pass because it's quite flat face.
[01:22] Down here, these vents open and shut as
[01:24] is needed for cooling to do with the
[01:25] battery and the general coolant system.
[01:27] The front end just looks cool. It looks
[01:28] beefy. It almost looks powerful, which I
[01:32] think that's what Kia were going for. A
[01:33] very strong, bold design choice. Looks
[01:37] cool. And this particular car is
[01:39] finished in shadow gray, a 750 premium
[01:41] paint option that looks really cool. One
[01:45] of my favorite colors that this could
[01:47] have been in. Although black on black on
[01:49] black would have potentially looked very
[01:50] good on this, though impossible
[01:52] impossible to keep clean. Now the side
[01:55] profile continues with that strong
[01:58] design language. Whilst it is quite
[01:59] flatsided, not a bad thing. Helps with
[02:01] aerodynamics. It's got very strong and
[02:04] sharp lines put in. Looks really cool.
[02:06] 21in alloy wheels, which technically a
[02:09] diamond cut, but they've also got this
[02:10] aerodynamic cover on them, which I
[02:13] really like. I I like the side profile
[02:15] of this. It is very long. like it's
[02:19] probably bigger than my bedroom in
[02:21] length, but it's a very cool looking
[02:23] thing and it stands out among the world
[02:27] of big abrasive EVs
[02:30] in Kia's own way as a flagship goes
[02:32] aesthetically.
[02:34] It's looking good. Oh yeah, and these
[02:36] door handles, they pop in and out
[02:39] completely by themselves, just like a
[02:40] futuristic spaceship.
[02:44] Totally unnecessary tech, but super
[02:47] cool. Now, finishing the back end off is
[02:49] difficult because it's a big car. SUVs,
[02:51] traditionally, big vehicles have big
[02:53] rear doors, and there's not a lot you
[02:55] can do with it. So, Kia have implemented
[02:58] some design language and that, okay,
[03:00] let's make the lights go into the door a
[03:02] little bit. I like the light cluster
[03:03] design. Looks really cool. Let's have
[03:06] brushed aluminium logo just to make it
[03:09] stand out a bit more. And let's just
[03:10] kind of simplify the back end because
[03:12] the design isn't shouty. It's quite
[03:14] nice. It's nothing too over the top and
[03:16] typically it's probably to help with
[03:18] aerodynamics because even the the rear
[03:20] spoiler comes down to help with that
[03:22] aerodynamic flow. Besides the EV9
[03:25] badging on the front and the GT line
[03:27] here, you don't really see much more
[03:30] shouting about what it is. No shouting
[03:32] about power or performance or that it's
[03:34] got six seats or that it cost £77,000 on
[03:38] the road. But the design is just very
[03:40] Kia. Doesn't need to shout too much
[03:42] because ultimately the car is what it
[03:44] is. It looks good. Doesn't have to shout
[03:46] about it too much. Now, the inside is
[03:49] the place that you get to on this car
[03:51] where you suddenly go, "Oh, wait." This
[03:54] is really fancy because the interior of
[03:56] this car is
[03:58] stylistic, aesthetically pleasing,
[04:01] comfortable, resourceful,
[04:04] good for you. Well, how, why, what,
[04:06] when? Let's start with the Meridian
[04:08] surround sound system. And Meridian back
[04:11] in the day for me, they were a JLR
[04:12] product, as in they were placed within
[04:14] every Jaguar Land Rover product. And
[04:16] they were good. They were really good.
[04:18] All of a sudden, it then changed up.
[04:20] They kind of disappeared a little bit,
[04:21] and they started going within different
[04:23] brands. Fast forward to today, and it's
[04:26] inside this EV9. And this sound system
[04:28] is incredible. And it's not an option.
[04:32] You go for an EV9 GT line. EV9 GT line.
[04:35] that rhymes. And it's just here. And
[04:38] what a great system it is. Beyond that,
[04:41] you get in and you're greeted by a huge
[04:44] infotainment and mix TFT cluster in
[04:46] front of you, which is easy to use, easy
[04:48] to navigate. There's an amount of
[04:50] buttons to actually use. Whilst there
[04:52] are a lot of menus, a lot of it's within
[04:54] reach within buttons. The buttons on the
[04:56] steering wheel are easy to learn and to
[04:59] navigate, but there there is a lot going
[05:01] on. Not going to deny that. Fast forward
[05:03] up to here. You can have a digital
[05:05] display on your center view mirror
[05:08] depending on if you want to see your
[05:09] back seat passengers or not. Look up and
[05:11] you've got not one but two sunroofs.
[05:15] Well, technically one sunroof and one
[05:17] panoramic sunroof. More on the rear in a
[05:20] minute. And the seats are just super
[05:22] super comfortable. Easy to choose how
[05:25] you want them set up. And you can even
[05:27] put them into like a a lounge reclining
[05:29] mode. And ergonomically, these seats are
[05:32] good for you because while you're
[05:33] driving, they adjust and help you to
[05:36] kind of stretch out. You've got massage
[05:37] function, heated and cooled seats.
[05:40] There's a lot going on here. Oh, and a
[05:42] heated steering wheel. And beyond that,
[05:44] there's cubby holes everywhere. So, from
[05:46] a family point of view, when you if you
[05:48] were doing a long road trip, bearing in
[05:50] mind you could easily do 250 mi in this
[05:52] car, and that's when you'd need to stop
[05:54] and recharge. For that 250 mi, you're
[05:57] comfortable. It's easy to drive. It's
[05:59] easy to see everything. The interior is
[06:00] nice to be in and there are cubby holes
[06:03] everywhere for every family essential
[06:05] that you could possibly think of. It's
[06:08] just really well done. It's comfortable
[06:10] and whilst it isn't shouting with
[06:12] different materials, there's a couple of
[06:15] material uses going on here. They work
[06:17] really well. I really like it. These
[06:19] things are great. Kia have done really
[06:22] well. Basically, yeah, it's good. Get
[06:25] yourself in the back seat. And that's
[06:26] where the luxury begins because this is
[06:29] a six-seater model. And the six-seater
[06:31] model means both of these chairs spin
[06:33] around to face the other way. Kind of
[06:35] turning it more into a minivan. But they
[06:38] are incredibly comfortable, can recline,
[06:40] are heated and cooled also, and give you
[06:43] bundles of leg room. Look up and you
[06:44] have a huge panoramic sunroof. In a
[06:47] minute, back's looking pretty good.
[06:49] There are also more cubby holes, more
[06:52] cup holders, more USBC chargers.
[06:56] There is everything back here. It's
[06:57] really well thought out. In fact, if you
[07:00] want a different temperature and
[07:02] different setup to the people in the
[07:03] front, you don't even have to ask them
[07:05] to change it. It's up here. It's easily
[07:08] done. There are vents in the roof. It's
[07:09] just well thought out. As a family car
[07:11] goes, it's exceptional because when you
[07:14] take six people, sometimes the kids in
[07:15] the back want to turn around and see the
[07:17] people in the back. Well, that's easily
[07:19] done. Just pull a lever, turn the seats
[07:20] around, jobs are good. But these seats
[07:22] are spacious. Are the backpack seats
[07:25] spacious? If you have these in full
[07:27] recline mode, maybe not. So, but put
[07:30] them in a slightly forward position,
[07:32] which still gives ample room, bearing in
[07:34] mind, car seats don't take up that much
[07:35] space. And the rear seats fit two fully
[07:38] grown adults
[07:40] easily.
[07:41] In fact, I can fit back there quite
[07:43] easily right now. Hello.
[07:47] So, this might genuinely be one of the
[07:50] better family cars that I could possibly
[07:52] have asked to get in because not only is
[07:54] it spacious and useful and full of
[07:56] technology, you can fit four ISOIX car
[07:59] seats in here, four ISOIX 360 spin car
[08:01] seats if you set the seats up in the
[08:03] right way. And that is ridiculous. No
[08:06] other manufacturer can offer that. That
[08:09] is incredible because if you look at
[08:10] things even like Mercedes Veto or Vano,
[08:15] they'll end up having one seat which
[08:16] can't take an ISOIX because of some
[08:18] silly regulation within their
[08:20] manufacturing, some policy. Whereas the
[08:23] Koreans at Kia have said we need to make
[08:26] sure that this can be versatile for
[08:28] everything anyone wants to to throw at
[08:30] it and that they have. This is very
[08:33] versatile and comfortable and luxurious,
[08:37] very family friendly. Finally, you come
[08:40] to the back of the car where the
[08:43] impressiveness
[08:45] doesn't stop. The boot because it's
[08:47] huge. Now, traditionally in a six or
[08:51] sevenseater vehicle with all the seats
[08:53] up, you have almost no space. But as you
[08:57] can see behind me, I have a Casato
[08:59] Whoosh 3. Ample space for this. Ample
[09:02] space for bassinet and eye candy 333
[09:06] L of boot capacity with all seats
[09:09] deployed. However, press a couple of
[09:12] buttons like so
[09:18] and electronically
[09:20] these seats go down. Press another
[09:21] button, those ones will go down. But I
[09:23] got stuff in the back seat and I don't
[09:24] want to crush it. But get those two down
[09:26] as well and all of a sudden you have
[09:27] access to an extra 2,000 L of boot
[09:32] capacity. 2,000 L, which puts this at
[09:35] 2,380
[09:37] something L of boot capacity. So much so
[09:41] that when I went to an event this week
[09:42] and I didn't want to pay £130 for a
[09:44] hotel, I just put a black mattress,
[09:46] double mattress in the back and had
[09:47] ample room and then looked up at the
[09:49] stars through the panoramic sunroof. You
[09:52] can put this in utility camping mode. It
[09:54] will keep you warm all night. There's a
[09:55] plug socket in the back here. There's
[09:57] everything. The boot capacity of this is
[09:59] just usable. Even if you're carrying
[10:03] people around, it's not difficult to
[10:05] fill this up with a normal amount of
[10:07] kit. It's just not what I'm used to in a
[10:10] 6 to 7seater vehicle. And the boot
[10:13] height's not difficult either.
[10:14] Obviously, if you got really heavy
[10:15] things, might be a bit more difficult.
[10:16] You might scrape the bumper a few times
[10:18] with really heavy things like if you
[10:20] wanted to move a dishwasher or a washing
[10:21] machine, but it would still be easily
[10:23] done.
[10:25] So yeah, the boot space is gargantuous.
[10:29] Now the drive of this is impressive
[10:32] because ultimately this is a 2.6 ton
[10:35] car, but it does have 378
[10:40] PS 700 new meters of torque and it's 5.2
[10:43] 5.3 to 62 mph. So, we are talking Golf R
[10:47] fast and I guess if you were that way
[10:49] inclined, you could probably spec a Golf
[10:51] R up to about £77,000 anyway. But this
[10:56] doesn't really drive like its size. So,
[11:00] hear me out. Whilst this is incredibly
[11:02] smooth and the driving feels really
[11:03] nice, the throttle response is good, the
[11:05] brake field doesn't feel massively EV.
[11:09] You can put this in ipedal mode and
[11:10] drive it quite easily on one pedal and
[11:12] it is comfortable. It is good. Throw
[11:15] this round corners and you barely feel
[11:17] the weight of it until you're really
[11:19] pushing on. Drive cycle wise, expect
[11:21] anywhere between 2.7 and 4 m per kowatt
[11:24] hour depending on your drive cycle
[11:26] because ultimately in the winter this is
[11:29] going to get more towards the 2.7, but I
[11:32] was only seeing 2.7 when I was pushing
[11:35] 70 mphish
[11:38] with air conditioning on with six people
[11:41] in it. And while I appreciate this is a
[11:43] heavy car,
[11:46] that's still impressive. I mean, by any
[11:48] means, but actually a different drive
[11:51] cycle. Still driving six people, still
[11:55] driving on the motorway at motorway
[11:57] speeds, and all of a sudden I was
[11:58] getting 3.4, 3.5. So, kind of depends
[12:01] on, I guess, headwinds, how many hills
[12:02] you've got. But, this is very good at
[12:04] getting good range. The performance is,
[12:08] I'm not going to say engaging, but it is
[12:10] fun. And for a big car to be able to
[12:12] move as fast as this does, it's just
[12:14] hilarious. The steering response is just
[12:17] reasonable. It's not giving you loads of
[12:19] feedback to the road, but it gives you
[12:21] enough to be able to enjoy the drive cuz
[12:24] technically it's a GT line. It should be
[12:26] a bit GT.
[12:29] And it is. It's fun. I mean, I'm just
[12:32] driving around town now and I'm getting
[12:34] 2.7 miles per kowatt hour after my first
[12:38] mile and a half mile, 1.3 miles of
[12:40] driving, not even trying. And I'm
[12:43] getting that. And when it comes to
[12:45] having some of the more aggressive
[12:47] driving input as you could quite easily
[12:50] do on this car, the seats are
[12:52] comfortable and pretty holding. Now,
[12:54] whilst they're not as holding as I would
[12:57] like for the faster pace driving, they
[12:59] do hold enough. And the bolster adaption
[13:02] is there. The side bolsters can be
[13:04] changed to grip you into the seat a bit
[13:06] more. And it's just a comfy car to drive
[13:09] long, short, whatever distances. It's
[13:11] really easy. Now I'm up to 3.5 m per
[13:13] kowatt hour. See, I'm not even trying.
[13:16] Although I am now stuck behind literally
[13:19] 100 cyclists. In summary, it's a good
[13:22] driving car. The performance is good,
[13:24] the economy is good,
[13:26] and it does beep and bong at you when
[13:28] you go near speed cameras, but nowhere
[13:31] near as bad as some other manufacturers.
[13:34] The beeping and bonging isn't over the
[13:36] top. And the techless at your fingertips
[13:37] is
[13:39] easy to navigate while you drive. It's
[13:41] just a comfy car to drive. And I'll add
[13:43] that your Apple CarPlay integration is
[13:45] good. Sound system is good to get you
[13:47] going for your fast-paced drive at the
[13:49] national speed limit.
[13:52] I just enjoy driving it
[13:56] and it's really well thought out for
[13:59] there's me going.1 milesPH over the
[14:02] speed limit.
[14:04] It's really well thought out for the
[14:06] family man who's a bit of a car geek who
[14:09] does enjoy his driving. You can enjoy it
[14:12] with this and still get really good fuel
[14:15] economy. Electric economy. It just say
[14:17] economy. Although technically electric
[14:21] although technically electricity is a
[14:23] fuel. So
[14:26] one final thing before we finish. The
[14:28] charger back here is touch operated. I
[14:32] mean totally bougie and unnecessary.
[14:34] And at 7 years old I'd be worried how
[14:36] much that will cost to fix. But it's so
[14:39] fancy and extra. And that's kind of
[14:42] that's kind of my summary of the EV9 cuz
[14:44] it is bougie. It is fancy. It is extra,
[14:48] but it's also good-looking and usable,
[14:52] nice to drive. 77K on the road is a lot
[14:55] of money. If you want a PCP on one of
[14:57] these with 8 grand down, you're still
[14:58] looking at about £1,000 a month. That's
[15:00] direct from Kia, though. Go to some
[15:02] places like Lease Loco and all of a
[15:04] sudden you'll be going, "Uh, wait a
[15:06] minute. I can get one of these for £600
[15:08] a month or less depending how much you
[15:09] put down. And for £600 a month, I
[15:12] actually don't know what else you could
[15:15] want to spend your family money on if
[15:17] you want an EV because six seats make it
[15:20] usable for bigger families. ISOIX on
[15:23] every rear seat makes it usable for
[15:25] families. A frunk and a trunk, although
[15:28] the frunk, to be fair, doesn't actually
[15:29] have a lot of space. It's just good for
[15:30] storing cables.
[15:33] But with all seats deployed, you can
[15:34] still fit pram and all sorts in a drive
[15:36] which is still relatively engaging and
[15:39] you really really don't feel the weight
[15:40] of this vehicle until you are absolutely
[15:42] pushing it through corners. Acceleration
[15:45] and a driving feel which is just nice
[15:48] and comfortable. An easy 300 mi of range
[15:51] with air con on in the summer at 70 mph.
[15:54] In the winter, expect more like 250 mi,
[15:56] but that's fair enough. But see up to
[15:59] 400 miles with everything off in the
[16:01] peak of summer driving with the windows
[16:03] down around town. That is for a vehicle
[16:05] of this size, ridiculous. And charge at
[16:08] home in this really doesn't cost all
[16:09] that much to run. Yes, it has a mahusive
[16:11] battery. And yes, if you plugged it into
[16:13] a 3.5 kW charger, it would take over 40
[16:15] hours to charge. Understandable. But
[16:18] it's good-looking. It's nice to drive.
[16:21] It's comfortable to be in. It's safe.
[16:22] It's familyfriendly. And Kia have ticked
[16:25] so many boxes. So, if you're thinking of
[16:27] trying one of these, definitely go and
[16:29] try it for yourself in whatever version,
[16:31] option, whatever you need it to be in
[16:34] because I think it's going to surprise
[16:36] you because when this turned up, I just
[16:37] thought it was going to be a massive
[16:39] behemoth and it will feel massively EV.
[16:43] But those days are long gone. This just
[16:46] feels like a good, solid, reliable,
[16:48] familyfriendly
[16:50] car, SUV, van. It's kind of everything.
[16:53] Good job, Kia.
