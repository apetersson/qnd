[00:02] This is the KIA EV9
[00:05] a family cruise ship for the road
[00:08] let me show you!
[00:11] first of all, it’s huge,
[00:13] just over 5 meters long and 2 meters wide
[00:18] this color is called Ocean Blue Matte
[00:22] love the front with these vertical headlights
[00:26] and huge daylight running lights
[00:30] front camera,
[00:32] active air flaps,
[00:34] and ADAS sensors
[00:36] 21' wheels with plastic covers
[00:39] to ease the pain should you scratch them
[00:43] this badge means it’s the highest spec and AWD
[00:47] it comes as no surprise that the EV9... is electric
[00:51] with a huge 96.0 kWh usable battery
[00:54] that can be charged at up to 11 kW AC or 209 kW DC
[01:01] ok, let’s gooo!
[01:04] I’ll show you the rest when we get back
[01:13] these flashing lights only show on camera
[01:16] 4 Drive Modes
[01:21] twist to shift
[01:24] 360 and 3D reversing camera
[01:29] sunroof,
[01:30] for when you live in a sunny place
[01:34] if you choose the side cameras instead of classic side mirrors
[01:38] the dashboard comes with an extra monitor on each side
[01:41] illuminated KIA logo
[01:44] brake recuperation paddles
[01:48] USB-C dock with charging or media control toggle
[01:52] 12V charge port
[01:55] 2-part touchscreen right of the dashboard part
[02:00] 4 heated and ventilated seats
[02:03] prank button for passengers in the 3rd row
[02:06] not a huge fan of these non-buttons
[02:10] recycled fabrics
[02:12] 2-color leather look seat trim
[02:17] glove box for many, many gloves
[02:21] possible trash can
[02:23] center storage
[02:25] or 2 cup holders
[02:27] fingerprint sensor for...
[02:30] safety?
[02:31] wireless charging tray
[02:33] with charging indicator
[02:35] more storage
[02:37] very nice interior lighting
[02:48] just like many Asian cars
[02:51] it beeps a lot
[02:52] it beeps a lot
[02:55] let’s have a chat with our KIA
[02:58] switch off warning sounds
[03:01] this feature is not supported
[03:05] what's the weather like in Brussels?
[03:09] currently it is raining in Brussels,
[03:10] with a temperature of 13 degrees Celsius
[03:13] what time is it?
[03:15] it's 01:01PM
[03:17] tell me a joke!
[03:20] this feature is not supported
[03:23] Meridian surround sound system with 14 speakers
[03:27] and a DSP filtering out unwanted EV noises
[03:33] time for some fast charging
[03:41] leftover of some crazy nerd party
[03:51] my battery still is 74% full
[03:54] so I’m not expecting any fast charging speeds
[03:57] on an earlier charging session, with only 7% battery left,
[04:01] I got a charging speed of over 200 kW
[04:05] not today
[04:11] let me show you a cool party trick,
[04:17] this all-wheel-drive version has a number of Terrain modes,
[04:22] so you can safely do this
[04:26] but you’ll also be doing a lot of this
[04:31] all clean and ready for some highway driving
[04:37] lovely Apple CarPlay integration
[04:41] actually these pink flashing dots on top of the steering wheel
[04:45] are forward attention assistants
[04:48] that start beeping when you don’t keep your eyes on the road
[04:52] there’s adaptive cruise control with active steer assist and lane change assist
[04:58] some of the dashboard screens
[05:02] and the assistant beeping because it can’t see my face
[05:07] an average of 23.2 kWh / 100 km so far
[05:11] I’ve set my charging limit to 80%
[05:14] because above 80% charging goes a lot slower
[05:18] I only charge to 100% when I really need the full range
[05:22] it does traffic jams very well
[05:26] basically driving itself
[05:32] the driver gets a massaging seat
[05:44] digital rear view mirror
[05:46] lovely head-up display
[05:49] that also shows your average speed during a section control
[05:54] soundtrack when accelerating in Sport Mode
[05:58] 0 to 100 km/h only takes 5.3 seconds
[06:01] and the top speed is 200 km/h
