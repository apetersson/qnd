[00:00] This is the Kia EV9 and I've been driving it for the
[00:02] last few weeks and it's going to be
[00:04] a bit complicated to work on today. It
[00:07] 's technically very good and in many
[00:09] ways more than solid. It's
[00:12] excellently equipped, at least in
[00:13] the four-wheel drive GT line and as a
[00:16] six-seater as it is here, for its
[00:19] modest €85,000. However,
[00:22] I would never buy it because
[00:24] I don't even consider it a car and
[00:27] because it really annoyed me in many ways and
[00:29] it ca
[00:32] n't do much of anything, at least not
[00:33] directly. As I said, it's getting
[00:35] a bit more complicated today and it's going to have to
[00:37] serve as a bit of a lightning rod.
[00:40] We need to talk about the elephant in the
[00:43] room, which
[00:46] could be the elephant in the room. The car is so big that it's
[00:48] uncomfortably big. It also attracts attention
[00:51] because it looks like a
[00:52] car-shaped incarnation of Robocop's
[00:54] helmet and because it's so big that
[00:57] passersby have nowhere else to look.
[00:59] Even though I'm slowly getting to the
[01:00] point where I could be thinking about a midlife
[01:02] crisis, these
[01:04] angular ships aren't really my thing. So the
[01:06] G-Class Land and Range Rover, I'm
[01:09] simply out. I'm thinking about something flatter for my midlife
[01:11] crisis without it.
[01:14] It was even more uncomfortable for me to
[01:17] drive to daycare in the EV9 and it was
[01:20] actually more of an effort than
[01:24] putting on a Vision Pro the first time on a crowded train. That was until
[01:26] I understood that this
[01:28] isn't a car at all, it's a
[01:31] minibus with a hood and then
[01:34] the math looks completely different.
[01:36] If you compare it with an ID bus,
[01:37] then at 5 m it's
[01:40] still a bit longer but
[01:41] even half a centimeter narrower and
[01:43] somehow 17 cm flatter or so. The
[01:46] exterior is certainly a
[01:47] matter of taste, but inside, Kia has
[01:49] certainly delivered. In the GT line,
[01:51] the equipment leaves little to be desired.
[01:54] As I said, in this case,
[01:56] the six-seater, which I
[01:58] can also have folded down from here to create an
[02:01] XXL trunk. There's
[02:04] a bit of additional storage space
[02:06] underneath here. There's a
[02:07] trunk cover here and a bit
[02:09] here. And if you only have the version with
[02:11] rear-wheel drive, then there's
[02:12] a bit more space up front. The seats
[02:14] are actually fantastic and
[02:16] that The first thing that caught my eye, and
[02:18] what several passengers also
[02:20] noticed, are the headrests. I do
[02:21] n't really understand it, but they
[02:23] are simply the very best headrests
[02:25] that have supported my head in a car so far.
[02:28] You can lay the seats down.
[02:30] But when I drive very close to
[02:32] them, they even have a leg
[02:34] rest, so you can relax very relaxed.
[02:37] You can relax very relaxed somewhere
[02:39] while you stop for charging.
[02:42] The seats are ventilated and
[02:44] heated in the first and second
[02:46] rows and they won't break your
[02:48] kneecaps in between. I'll be
[02:50] right back where I need to be.
[02:51] You can even turn the second row of seats,
[02:53] and the driver also has a
[02:56] massage function. We should
[02:58] perhaps talk briefly about
[02:59] human anatomy here. The
[03:01] massage function can basically do two
[03:03] things. It can
[03:05] juggle your buttocks a bit and
[03:10] press in at different forces on both sides in the lumbar area,
[03:11] or remove the support function completely.
[03:13] You can request this individually, and
[03:16] everything together. And turning both on together
[03:18] means your whole
[03:23] body. For me, that was the first time
[03:25] that I had actually lived with a
[03:27] massage function in a car. You
[03:30] can set it so that it should process you
[03:32] at regular intervals during
[03:34] long journeys and I have to
[03:36] say that's actually quite nice.
[03:38] Otherwise, you have a very
[03:41] responsive touchscreen here at the front, a
[03:43] ventilation display next to it, and that all goes
[03:45] into the speedometer area.
[03:47] We'll talk about all the software nitty-gritty in a moment.
[03:50] Otherwise, it
[03:51] also has these physical rocker switches. This
[03:53] is apparently the
[03:55] height of automotive
[03:58] creation for some people. I don't know. I
[04:00] normally
[04:01] set a temperature when I'm in the car and
[04:03] adjust it maybe once per journey. There are
[04:06] also these touch
[04:07] buttons, and I think they have a kind of
[04:09] vibration feedback where
[04:11] all this fake carbon wobbles a bit,
[04:13] and I just don't like the feel of that.
[04:15] I also find the selection a bit
[04:16] wild as to what's been lasered in here. So the
[04:19] setup is simply a permanent
[04:22] thing, and also because this
[04:24] is something you
[04:25] touch regularly, this thing is very
[04:27] susceptible to fingerprints. And speaking of
[04:30] fingerprints, there's a
[04:33] fingerprint sensor here to select your user profile
[04:35] and potentially, I think,
[04:37] to unlock the car as well. For
[04:38] some reason, it needs But you need two
[04:41] keys to add a fingerprint, for whatever reason,
[04:42] but guess
[04:45] how many keys you get when you're given
[04:47] a car like that to test, a
[04:49] little spoiler, the answer is
[04:51] less than two and I would also need
[04:54] two to set up a phone key,
[04:57] that would actually be a feature for me
[05:00] if I were to buy a car,
[05:02] without which I wouldn't buy a car again,
[05:05] I can't
[05:06] imagine
[05:07] carrying something like that with me every day and
[05:11] always having to remember it, but
[05:13] I do need it because the door handles don't
[05:14] always come out when I
[05:16] need them, for example if we're out with the kids
[05:18] and I get out and
[05:23] want to open the back door for the kids, they don't come out, I have to
[05:25] unlock it separately, that's really
[05:27] annoying, well, not really,
[05:29] we'll come to that in a minute, and if
[05:31] I take the speed of the other
[05:32] app controls as an indicator of the quality of
[05:35] this function,
[05:36] I'm not putting too much
[05:39] hope in it, so if it
[05:41] works, because the commands in the app
[05:43] fail, I'd say roughly
[05:46] halfway through the attempt, one positive thing to highlight
[05:48] is that
[05:50] USB ports are distributed throughout the car, here, here, and
[05:55] even here at the back. There's
[05:57] even a full-sized power socket in the trunk.
[05:58] Unfortunately, there's only a
[06:00] cell phone charging tray here, and I'd really
[06:02] like both of them to have one in the front. There's plenty of
[06:04] room, not just
[06:07] for the large
[06:08] handbag tray in the middle, but also
[06:10] everywhere else. It's just a
[06:13] huge vehicle, and our children
[06:16] love this indoor playground, being
[06:17] able to run back between the seats,
[06:19] or when they're sitting in the back, being able to
[06:22] climb into the trunk during breaks. The
[06:26] six-seater version has Isofix everywhere from the
[06:29] second seat onwards, so four child seats are
[06:31] no problem at all. Let's also talk
[06:33] about the downside of the size. I mean,
[06:35] we've got a 2.8
[06:37] ton, 5 m long, 2 m wide, and almost 180 cm
[06:40] high ship that we
[06:42] maneuver around. And that obviously has an
[06:44] impact on fuel consumption because of its shape.
[06:47] The drag coefficient of the EV9 is only supposed to be
[06:50] 0.28, which is on
[06:53] par with the EV6. It's not an
[06:55] outstandingly good value, but it's
[06:57] not bad either, and definitely
[06:58] better than what I would have expected for a
[07:00] mobile fitted kitchen.
[07:02] It also steers here in the front. through
[07:03] somehow opening and closing
[07:05] air intakes, everything somehow
[07:07] flows a bit like an Aventador,
[07:10] although when I look at it, it's more like
[07:12] an Aventador upright perhaps and
[07:14] the flies up front don't know
[07:15] anything about its aerodynamics
[07:16] I'm afraid you have to give Kia credit here too,
[07:19] the consumption
[07:20] isn't that extreme they state it at an average of 22.8 kW
[07:24] hours per 100 km,
[07:26] we didn't reach that during my
[07:28] test period with around 1000 km that
[07:30] we drove it, on
[07:32] average with a lot of motorway it was around 25 kW
[07:35] hours but it also depends a lot on
[07:37] your driving style from 130 kmh you're
[07:40] quickly over 30 I don't even want to
[07:43] imagine how many idiots
[07:44] here would babble about new nuclear power plants
[07:46] if I were to tell you what it
[07:48] consumes at its 200 kmh top speed, I
[07:51] honestly don't even know because
[07:53] I didn't drive it constantly at high speeds, but I can still just
[07:57] switch to sport mode and then use the 35
[08:00] 80 hp to somehow
[08:02] Overtaking a tractor works quite
[08:04] well and pressing your head into the very
[08:07] fabulous headrest is no less
[08:09] fabulous today's sponsor Saal
[08:11] Digital and I'm actually
[08:13] very happy that they're back after your
[08:15] positive feedback last time Sal
[08:18] Digital delivers high-quality prints and
[08:20] we have, for example, our entire hallway full
[08:22] of beautiful family photos as Feinart
[08:25] Prince von Saal, but they'll give you
[08:27] a damp printer coat.
[08:30] Last time I showed you our
[08:31] beautiful coffeeable book from
[08:33] our New Zealand trip and as a
[08:36] result I realized that I just want to
[08:45] remember the feeling of being completely overwhelmed by the many impressions of nature in a very short space of time. So I ordered a gallery print of one of the pictures for
[08:48] my new work area in the new
[08:50] house.
[08:52] In an ever-
[08:54] growing digital photo collection,
[08:55] individual changes unfortunately tend to get lost more and more,
[08:58] but you know what doesn't get lost,
[09:00] a board like this is an
[09:02] acrylic glass gallery print, which is
[09:07] printed in seven colors directly onto the acrylic glass and therefore offers
[09:09] the highest
[09:12] resolution and maximum sharpness even in the light colors. The
[09:14] gallery print puts your favorite photo
[09:17] in the best light and can transform any room into
[09:19] a Transform it into an art gallery, you can
[09:23] customize it from the hanging system to the frame, just like
[09:25] you can cut the size to the exact centimeter for
[09:28] your picture or your room,
[09:29] and I just like to
[09:34] continue celebrating a vacation that really meant a lot to us,
[09:36] and using the link below
[09:38] you will receive a €20 discount on your
[09:40] next order from Saal digital for
[09:42] purchases over €40, and I
[09:45] will personally use this to
[09:47] order a few more pictures, which
[09:49] I can then pixel for you again next time,
[09:50] thanks to Saal digital,
[09:53] the consumption is certainly okay for what it is,
[09:55] and if the
[09:57] power comes from your roof it doesn't
[09:59] matter anyway, what's cool is parking the thing,
[10:00] even though it has everything you'd expect in
[10:03] auxiliary views on board, a rear camera, a front
[10:05] camera, 3D views from everywhere, that
[10:08] 's actually very valuable, because
[10:09] I can't see my three-year-old son
[10:12] when he's standing in front of the car, with the 100
[10:15] watt-hour battery it shows me a
[10:17] good 425 km range in eco mode, and
[10:22] if you don't go over 125 on the motorway,
[10:24] then I'd say that it's
[10:26] definitely within Realistic
[10:31] at least given the current temperatures, however, the software does
[10:34] n't like it when you take risks,
[10:35] so if I navigate so that I
[10:37] arrive at my destination with 11-12%, then it really wants me to
[10:43] plan a charging stop, including preconditioning
[10:45] the battery, which in case of doubt
[10:47] means that 11-12% might
[10:49] be a bit low, so the car
[10:52] seemed overly cautious here, not
[10:54] wanting to break down or not
[10:57] trusting itself to rely on its own estimate,
[10:59] but I think that's a
[11:00] pretty good transition, the software looks
[11:03] really good in many places,
[11:05] so if you
[11:06] ignore the retrofit of the built-in navigation system, it's
[11:11] very well thought out in many places, whether it's really necessary that
[11:15] the ventilation
[11:17] is switched to recirculation when using the windscreen wipers so that I
[11:19] don't smell the windscreen washer fluid,
[11:22] I don't know, what am I paying
[11:23] more for at the gas station than
[11:26] for mouse milk for some kind of summer
[11:29] windscreen washer fluid with a tropical punch flavor,
[11:32] personally, the whole thing could
[11:33] actually be a bit more
[11:34] touchscreen-focused, and I do
[11:36] n't really want to admit how It
[11:39] took me a long time to ventilate my seat.
[11:41] I simply went to the seats
[11:44] and thought, well,
[11:46] I can
[11:47] do some things here, but that's all the heating,
[11:49] air conditioning, folding down the second or third
[11:52] row, I can do all that from
[11:54] here, but where can I
[11:57] ventilate my backside? I
[11:59] really searched for a long time until I saw
[12:01] that there are buttons built in for that,
[12:04] but I don't want to go on an
[12:06] Easter egg hunt for buttons in the interior.
[12:09] I want logical menus and at least being
[12:14] able to control these seats via the touchscreen should be possible somehow.
[12:16] In the blazing sun,
[12:18] for example, I can't tell if it's on or
[12:21] off. Now I see that there are a few
[12:24] nice functions, such as a
[12:25] built-in speed camera warning, which is
[12:28] of course completely illegal here in this country, which is
[12:30] why the settings say that you
[12:32] can only use it if you're
[12:34] actually allowed to use it. You can
[12:36] still use it, but of
[12:38] course I can't say anything about that because
[12:39] it's not allowed here,
[12:42] except that it's very nicely done and
[12:44] the
[12:46] ambient lighting even
[12:48] warns when a warning is needed, then
[12:50] of course it has everything you need.
[12:52] nowadays it's kind of expected it has
[12:55] an adaptive cruise control it has a
[12:57] lane keeping function everything which makes
[12:58] long journeys more bearable I notice
[13:00] with Kia as well as with the current Smarts
[13:02] that other manufacturers are more relaxed about
[13:05] when you are supported with these functions
[13:07] and when not than
[13:09] my Tesla, for example, where there is a hard
[13:12] mode here you are supported in
[13:14] this car you can
[13:16] change lanes yourself and then
[13:18] it takes over the steering wheel again most of the time
[13:21] at least sometimes you drift off a bit
[13:24] until you realize no it's
[13:26] not going to do that now I don't want to say that
[13:28] one version is better than the
[13:29] other because my Tesla has
[13:32] tried to kill me several times too I would
[13:34] say as long as the human monitors the machine
[13:37] and the machine monitors the human
[13:39] I consider both to be a great
[13:41] improvement in safety and comfort
[13:42] but let's get to the part which I consider to be
[13:45] the opposite
[13:47] driver assistance systems or the built-in
[13:49] mothering by the car that is I don't know
[13:54] thankfully stipulated
[13:57] that this will be included in all new cars from the summer and I do
[13:59] n't know exactly what the requirements
[14:02] are and how much leeway a
[14:03] car manufacturer has so what I am
[14:04] saying now is not a criticism of ev9
[14:07] but my fear of everything that is
[14:11] now coming to us in new cars and
[14:13] I would say we should work on that one at a time
[14:15] because that was really no fun
[14:19] this car beeps is mandatory
[14:22] in the future some kind of
[14:24] traffic sign recognition function or
[14:25] at least a notification when the
[14:27] speed changes and that means
[14:28] that you hear a ping in the interior every time the
[14:30] permitted maximum speed changes
[14:32] but not only that
[14:35] if you drive with cruise control and distance and lane
[14:38] keeping stuff and whatever
[14:39] and
[14:41] set it to the maximum speed then
[14:43] in this case it regulates itself so
[14:46] you are driving on a country road
[14:48] at 100 and suddenly the permitted speed is only 70
[14:50] you hear the ping for the
[14:52] changed speed shortly afterwards
[14:54] you hear another ping where the
[14:56] cruise control tells you I have
[14:59] now adjusted to the new
[15:00] maximum speed but you are
[15:02] still driving 100 and the car then starts to
[15:03] reduce the speed in this
[15:06] period until it reaches 70
[15:09] the speed symbol flashes violently
[15:11] both in the display
[15:13] and in the head-up display which by the way is by
[15:15] far better than in the EV6 back then,
[15:17] so it wasn't my eyes that had this
[15:20] behavior, as they say in
[15:23] automotive language, is really annoying. What makes it
[15:25] worse is that the
[15:26] sign recognition in any car I've driven so far hasn't
[15:29] worked even remotely well enough for me to find
[15:32] it acceptable when
[15:33] the car takes the liberty of criticizing me based on it. When
[15:37] roads split, the speed limit signs are often
[15:41] read out. The small
[15:43] restriction signs below
[15:44] speed limits are simply
[15:46] completely ignored and then they start talking my ear
[15:48] off when the car thinks I'm
[15:50] only allowed to drive 30 on the country road,
[15:52] but that only applies between 8 a.m. and 6
[15:55] p.m. and I'm driving in the evening,
[15:57] or I can just blast into a
[16:00] town at 100 without a care in the world because the
[16:02] recognition of town entrance signs
[16:03] only works in 63% of cases at most.
[16:06] I don't want to be
[16:08] lectured about my driving style by someone like that,
[16:10] but it gets worse because
[16:17] attention recognition is also mandatory from summer onwards. I have to take a deep
[16:19] breath. If you're not
[16:22] staring out of the windscreen at the front,
[16:24] the car will yell at you with a true tone and here
[16:27] a small blinking eye and
[16:29] now a period after it whistles at you is
[16:32] often just silly you choose
[16:35] a different song here the eye PT
[16:38] once briefly here the trip
[16:40] range stories built up which
[16:42] are specifically here so that I can
[16:45] still see the road in the peripheral field of vision gives you an
[16:47] immediate slap on the wrist but the
[16:49] worst thing is when I quickly look in the wing mirror on the motorway to
[16:51] see
[16:53] when I can pull out
[16:56] the eye immediately comes and beeps at me I do
[16:58] n't know is something really happening
[16:59] that I have to react to or does
[17:01] the car just feel like it needs to
[17:03] discipline me again if you
[17:08] put several of these things where you are being disciplined together and in between
[17:09] don't just stare out of
[17:11] the window long enough then it can
[17:14] happen that this eye escalates into a
[17:17] coffee cup which then blinks
[17:20] here and you can't appease it by just
[17:21] looking forward it
[17:23] really whistles at you for
[17:26] a lot longer and more penetratively
[17:29] and as I don't drink coffee I'm
[17:32] only half familiar with what it's trying to
[17:34] tell me anyway it's supposed to but
[17:35] mean that I need a break and
[17:38] am apparently
[17:40] supposed to consume a hot drink that tastes repulsive.
[17:42] This patronizing attitude has
[17:44] really taken the fun out of this car and
[17:46] long journeys for me. Not because I think
[17:48] it's a fundamentally bad idea for
[17:51] someone to pay attention to the front
[17:53] and not do anything silly in the car
[17:55] while
[17:56] driving, but not allowing me to
[17:59] look at the mirror or even briefly
[18:01] at the display. I don't know. My
[18:04] wife said after a short ride in
[18:07] this car, it beeps quite a
[18:09] lot and that actually sums it up quite
[18:12] well. Do you know when it didn't work? When
[18:14] I
[18:17] drove a long distance home last night and
[18:19] was probably really too tired and should have taken
[18:21] a break, there was
[18:23] no reaction. Luckily, this
[18:26] mothering goes to sleep like a canary immediately
[18:28] if you put a cloth over it. I have
[18:31] no idea if that's legal. In my
[18:33] opinion, it's an absolute SGO. Personally, I
[18:36] just like to put my
[18:38] tissues here on the
[18:40] steering wheel. I think that's perfectly normal,
[18:41] then the little camera or the
[18:43] sensor or whatever is in here ca
[18:44] n't see you and then it's quiet,
[18:47] except for the traffic signs. But
[18:51] covering it up makes long journeys
[18:52] 300% more bearable but as I said this
[18:56] is not legal advice
[18:58] and I want to look into it as well
[18:59] probably highly illegal and
[19:01] I have never done it the Kia ev9
[19:03] is a very good motor vehicle which has a
[19:06] strong tendency to mother me technically
[19:08] also S Sentences like how do you check
[19:11] the interior for luggage and passengers
[19:14] sounds so strange, like a
[19:17] government run by a computer. Most of
[19:20] what annoys me will probably apply to
[19:23] most new cars in the future.
[19:25] I mean, I'd be happy to find
[19:27] out for you if other
[19:29] manufacturers had mercy. I have to
[19:31] chime in again from a bit of distance.
[19:33] Now that the EV9 is gone,
[19:36] I can say I miss it a bit. It was
[19:38] fun and also
[19:41] sitting in the back where I really
[19:43] had space. I
[19:45] could have gone on holiday in the third row of seats
[19:48] if I had sat in front of me in the second.
[19:50] Each one has its own
[19:52] ventilation, its own charging port and cup
[19:54] holder. It has pretty much
[19:56] every everyday luxury I could
[19:58] wish for, or even a lot of
[20:00] technical gadgets or little
[20:02] comfort features like being able to completely control
[20:03] the passenger seat from the driver's seat.
[20:05] At the end
[20:07] of the day, it's still far too big for us personally,
[20:09] but with three or four children,
[20:11] or if you often drive somewhere with other people,
[20:13] it's actually
[20:15] a really good option. There are lots of
[20:17] little things. I've shown you a few reasons
[20:19] why it still doesn't have the highest
[20:20] recuperation level. simply saves and
[20:23] I have to reset it for every trip,
[20:26] I didn't understand it with the ev6 and it
[20:28] still doesn't understand it today and
[20:30] after I had recorded the actual video I had the
[20:34] on-board computer simply stop displaying anything, there is
[20:39] actually a hidden little
[20:41] reset button next to the volume control
[20:44] in the middle and if you press it in briefly with a
[20:45] ballpoint pen
[20:46] it resets and then works
[20:51] again, something that I
[20:53] know from small smarthome sensors and
[20:58] I can't even test the whole bidirectional charging option at the moment, feel
[21:00] free to subscribe to the channel, it's a
[21:02] topic that I would like to tackle when
[21:05] we get to the new house because there will be
[21:07] one until then, keep watching here
