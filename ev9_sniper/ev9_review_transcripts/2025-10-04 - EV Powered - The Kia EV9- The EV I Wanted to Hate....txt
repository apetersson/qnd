[00:01] so this it's the K ev9 and it's Kia's
[00:05] Flagship vehicle I also wanted to hate
[00:08] it I'm George and welcome to EV
[00:15] powered I really want to do
[00:19] it give something
[00:21] baby
[00:24] give now originally I'm from Essex in
[00:27] case you couldn't tell so it should be a
[00:29] surprise that I don't really like SUVs I
[00:32] find them a bit big quite uninspiring a
[00:35] bit silly and you know when they weigh 3
[00:38] tons like the
[00:39] ev9 just a bit
[00:41] unnecessary yet over the last week with
[00:43] this car my God have I been proven wrong
[00:46] in my
[00:48] prejudices so the kv9 is completely size
[00:52] inappropriate for UK roads it's over 5 m
[00:55] long which is more than the first ever
[00:57] swimming certificate I got at school
[00:59] it's 2 M wide and it's also 1.7 m tall
[01:05] and that's taller than
[01:07] [Music]
[01:10] me the kir 9's design well it uses K's
[01:15] opposites United philosophy that it also
[01:17] used on its EV3 which is essentially a
[01:20] small shrunken down version of the nine
[01:25] we have these I don't really know how to
[01:27] describe them but these really quite
[01:28] cool looking lights here and this chunky
[01:31] black body work in the cladding it
[01:33] provides a nice sense of contrast
[01:35] especially with this silvery green paint
[01:38] work and the ev9 also has these D
[01:41] handles which eject as you come near it
[01:43] and unlike the ev6 which has these kind
[01:46] of Tesla things that you have to poke
[01:48] and then they come out these come out
[01:51] automatically and there you
[01:54] go
[01:57] easy so I have a massive head like a
[02:01] however I can fit that in the EV 9's
[02:04] 19in rim and the 19in rim is also
[02:08] covered with an aerrow guard to improve
[02:10] aerodynamic
[02:11] efficiency just to show you how big this
[02:14] is if I stand
[02:17] up the top of the wheel comes to my
[02:20] thigh I could also
[02:23] basically fit my entire hand in
[02:26] there it's thick
[02:32] inside the Ki v9 is absolutely
[02:35] everything you would expect from a
[02:36] £65,000 all electric SUV now even though
[02:40] this is the entrylevel airs speec car
[02:43] there's absolutely no shortage of
[02:45] equipment there's this rather nice
[02:47] fabric insert on the dashboard which is
[02:49] very pul star esque and this this gray
[02:52] trim which I'm I don't really know about
[02:56] this because I see what K's tried to do
[02:59] after all piano black is a bit of a pain
[03:01] in the ass and it's a bit fingerprint
[03:03] but this it looks a bit baked Lighty
[03:06] like something you'd find in your Nan's
[03:08] kitchen up front there's a 12.3in
[03:11] infotainment display which has all the
[03:13] car's basic functions and uh Apple
[03:18] carplay there's also a 12.3in driver
[03:21] display and a 5.3 in uh well small panel
[03:25] or small uh touch screen that helps
[03:27] control the um the HVAC systems but if
[03:31] you touch that when you're driving
[03:33] you'll crash and die so don't do that uh
[03:35] down here we have one two USB C ports
[03:40] now as much as I
[03:41] complained about this small panel here
[03:44] what you can do is press this x at the
[03:47] top and it will turn the screen into a
[03:51] uh into an HVAC system but you can also
[03:54] adjust that with actual physical buttons
[03:57] and these are all nice and tactile
[03:59] inside and and uh you can use them if
[04:03] you're a bit
[04:08] [Music]
[04:13] greasy as you would expect from a 3 ton
[04:16] SUV with three rows of seats the space
[04:19] is
[04:21] plentiful and also what I quite like
[04:23] there's also a function panel up here
[04:25] which controls the temperature in the
[04:26] back uh USB C ports here and here here
[04:30] and these really really rather lovely
[04:33] and tactile air vents that are placed in
[04:36] the roof for uh your rear three
[04:39] occupants and as for the third row of
[04:41] seats well I will show you if you press
[04:44] this button here on the top of either on
[04:48] either far
[04:50] seat it will come
[04:53] forward
[04:54] and
[04:56] and you get in the back
[05:00] [Music]
[05:05] as per the law of car journalism I must
[05:08] again talk about my height as a reminder
[05:10] again I'm 5' 10 and
[05:13] really there's not much space here and I
[05:16] don't think that these well I don't
[05:18] think that this this row of back seats
[05:20] is much use unless you're a child or a
[05:23] very little person I mean I am sort of
[05:26] trapped I can't move my legs and I sort
[05:29] of feel like one of those monkeys in a
[05:30] zoo that's
[05:31] trapped it's not very
[05:34] comfortable can I come out
[05:36] [Music]
[05:41] now so boot space well for a 3 ton SUV
[05:47] with three rows of
[05:48] seats well it's going to be pretty
[05:50] cavernous isn't it so with the extremely
[05:54] comfortable rear seats up the third row
[05:56] that we saw earlier there's 333 L but
[06:00] if I press these two buttons
[06:04] here using the magic of
[06:06] electricity they'll fold
[06:11] down and give
[06:13] you
[06:15] 2,000
[06:17] 318 lers of space unsurprisingly there's
[06:21] plenty of space up front as well if you
[06:24] slide your hand under here under the K
[06:26] and the backwards Russian end so the uh
[06:28] bilingual K badge there a 90 L frunk
[06:32] which contains well doesn't just contain
[06:34] it holds everything you need for
[06:37] lunch and that brings us on to
[06:41] this one of the things that happens with
[06:44] EVS is when you're charging and there
[06:45] are plenty of decent places to charge is
[06:49] that you are faced with places that
[06:51] aren't great to eat you can either spend
[06:54] 20 and go to KFC and risk growing
[06:57] breasts or food poisoning or something
[06:59] like that or or you could take a grill
[07:02] or an electric barbecue or something
[07:04] take that with you use your car's
[07:07] vehicle to load Port which in this case
[07:10] is a three pin in the back here with a
[07:12] maximum capacity of 250 volts and cook
[07:17] yourself
[07:19] well a reasonably healthy
[07:23] lunch now you're also probably wondering
[07:26] what is vehicle to load well vehicle to
[07:28] load it uses up to 80% % of the car's
[07:30] battery or the 80% of the car's power to
[07:33] power an external source so for example
[07:37] that could be a grill that could be if
[07:38] you're going camping with the family or
[07:40] something like a TV or a uh or a fridge
[07:44] or well basically anything that you can
[07:46] plug in you can basically use it to
[07:48] eliminate the need for a uh big old
[07:51] dirty generator
[07:54] [Music]
[08:05] so as for driving impressions
[08:10] well it's everything you'd expect from a
[08:12] 3ton 200 brake horsepower uh SUV it's
[08:16] not it's not going to be troubling the
[08:18] likes of an ionic 5n or something and
[08:21] but for the most part it is and we've
[08:24] just been held up by some ducks we're
[08:26] not we're not getting through there
[08:28] unfortunately
[08:31] um but yes it is relatively easy to
[08:34] drive and I do like the gear selector
[08:36] down here that's reminiscent of uh old
[08:38] American SUVs of the ' 80s and 90s
[08:41] however what I did notice the other day
[08:43] when I was on a run is that if you don't
[08:45] turn off the lane assist it will try and
[08:48] kill you so what will happen is you'll
[08:50] quickly lose your temper and then lose
[08:53] control of the car but the good thing is
[08:54] is it's pretty easy to turn off because
[08:56] you hold it down for about 3 seconds 4
[08:58] seconds and then then you're back in
[09:00] control of the
[09:01] vehicle there's some seagulls there as
[09:04] well now they're holding us up too
[09:06] [Music]
[09:09] look it's like just stop oil but
[09:11] [Music]
[09:14] cute
[09:17] [Music]
[09:20] move so um now that we're no longer
[09:22] being uh held up by ducks and that foul
[09:26] play um what's the ev9 like to drive
[09:29] well as long as you turn the driver
[09:32] assists off and the lane assist and all
[09:33] that it is incredibly relaxing I mean
[09:38] like I said when I came into driving
[09:40] this and when it turned up at my house I
[09:42] was just quite ambivalent about the
[09:44] whole thing but having done a couple of
[09:47] long drives it's utterly utterly
[09:50] brilliant
[09:52] and if I could honestly if it was a bit
[09:55] smaller I definitely think I could uh
[09:59] fit it into my life Life as a daily
[10:00] driver and uh well that's what the k ev5
[10:05] is about later this
[10:10] year so do I like the K v9 well as a
[10:14] matter of fact yeah I kind of love it
[10:17] like I said I wasn't too interested when
[10:19] it arrived this week and again it's not
[10:21] perfect this system here isn't great um
[10:25] it's too big but these floors they they
[10:28] give it an inherent love able quality
[10:30] that the ev6 just doesn't have I love
[10:33] how comfortable it is I really love the
[10:36] sort of Minecraft s looks as well but
[10:38] don't go thinking that this is a silly
[10:40] or a novelty vehicle uh vehicle at all
[10:43] because as I said to you earlier this is
[10:45] pulling higher than the efficiency
[10:48] figures that KIA that KIA quoted 3.3
[10:51] I've gotten and uh Kia quotes
[10:54] 3.1 and again like I said I got it up to
[10:57] 4.6 m per Kow which is almost class
[11:01] leading Tesla levels of class
[11:03] leading so yeah would I have
[11:07] one no but I would if it was a little
[11:10] bit
[11:11] smaller Q the V5
[11:19] [Music]
