[00:00] Welcome everyone to the Hyundai Ionic 9,
[00:04] a car that answers a question that,
[00:06] well, no one really asked. What if my
[00:08] house had wheels? Yes, this is Hyundai's
[00:11] biggest and most unapologetically bold
[00:13] attempt at an electric family car yet.
[00:16] It's an SUV/ estate car that seats no
[00:19] less than seven, drives 385 miles on a
[00:23] single charge, and it looks a bit like
[00:25] it's been designed by someone who's been
[00:27] playing a bit too much Minecraft. But
[00:30] the good news is I have managed to get
[00:32] my hands on one of the first righthand
[00:35] drive versions here in the UK. I was
[00:38] thinking about it, it would just be a
[00:39] bit rude, wouldn't it, to keep it all to
[00:42] myself. I mean, it's not like we're
[00:43] talking about chocolate because clearly
[00:45] that's not sharable. But before we crack
[00:47] on, do share some love with us and
[00:49] subscribe to the channel.
[00:53] Now, if you've ever wondered what the
[00:55] love child of the Kia EV9 and the Audi
[00:57] A6 Ron event would look like, well, look
[01:01] no further. That's it, isn't it? Let's
[01:04] start with the obvious, though, because
[01:06] this car is absolutely enormous. It's
[01:09] the biggest thing that Hyundai has ever
[01:12] built, possibly including their offices.
[01:16] But this car shares a platform with the
[01:18] Kia EV9, which basically means that it's
[01:21] the same size, just a smidge taller.
[01:25] It's also bigger than its nearest rival,
[01:27] the 7seat Peugeot E58.
[01:32] But size in this case really does mean
[01:34] comfort. You can choose between six or
[01:36] seven seats. But this calligraphy
[01:38] version gets captain's chairs in the
[01:41] middle row, so you can pretend you're
[01:43] flying business class Emirates when in
[01:47] fact you're stuck in a traffic jam on
[01:49] the M25.
[01:52] Now, in terms of design, I think the
[01:54] giveaway that this is a Hyundai are the
[01:57] pixels. They're absolutely everywhere.
[01:59] Fun fact for you, the perfect pixel is
[02:03] actually a letter in the Korean
[02:05] alphabet. There you go. Use that in your
[02:08] next pub quiz. Now, in terms of the
[02:10] shape, it's a lot less boxy than the Kia
[02:13] EV9. It's more streamlined. It's
[02:16] sleeker. But this sloping roof line
[02:18] isn't just for style. It actually makes
[02:20] it more aerodynamic and therefore more
[02:22] efficient, which means more miles per
[02:25] charge. Love it. Now, when it comes to
[02:27] the wheels, 19 as standard, 20 and 21 in
[02:30] as an option. Now, on the calligraphy
[02:32] model, we have the 21 in, and it comes
[02:34] with this rather nice design on the
[02:37] wheels, spokes that have been inspired
[02:40] by the turbo of an aircraft. I don't
[02:43] think it's going to take off, but it
[02:45] does look very nice. This comes in three
[02:47] different trims and 10 different colors.
[02:50] This green is called ionosphere green.
[02:54] And you know what? For a green, I think
[02:56] it's rather attractive.
[02:59] All Ioni 9 models feature a 110 kWh
[03:02] battery with a choice of single or dual
[03:04] motors or with a heat pump as standard
[03:06] manually selectable battery conditioning
[03:08] which is a great feature along with
[03:10] vehicle to load so you can use your car
[03:12] as a mobile battery. Now that battery is
[03:16] Hyundai's largest yet and gives an
[03:18] official range of up to 385 miles in the
[03:22] single motor version. With the dual
[03:24] motor, it drops to around 350 mi. Now,
[03:28] that puts it on a par with its sibling,
[03:30] the Kia EV9, and is almost bang on with
[03:34] the Volvo EX90 single motor version.
[03:38] Despite the Ionic 9 having a massive
[03:40] battery, it can still top up on the go
[03:42] quickly thanks to a top charging speed
[03:44] of 233 kW. So that means if you can get
[03:47] on a charger that can deliver that level
[03:49] of power, you can get from 10 to 80% in
[03:53] 24 minutes. AC charging is capped at 11
[03:57] kW. And to be honest, I'd have liked to
[03:59] have seen 22 kW offered so that it can
[04:01] take advantage of the lamp post charging
[04:03] points that are popping up in our towns
[04:05] and cities.
[04:09] We'll take a look inside. It's a very
[04:12] nice place to be. I must say it's very
[04:14] ionic because whilst being quite sturdy,
[04:17] quite robust, it's also very serene and
[04:23] quite calm, very Korean, I would say, in
[04:25] terms of the design. Um, little things
[04:27] like I love how the screen is floating.
[04:31] I love how slim the air vents are, so
[04:35] it's very streamlined. Um, they've
[04:37] obviously paid quite a lot of attention
[04:38] to the design of the interior. I mean,
[04:40] you got lots of screens going on because
[04:42] not only have you got the double digital
[04:44] display in front of you, you've also got
[04:47] your display screen for your wing
[04:50] mirrors, which I'm never a huge fan of.
[04:54] And then obviously there's lots and lots
[04:56] of pixels everywhere.
[04:59] Slight overkill. Do we really need so
[05:01] many pixels down here, you know, for
[05:03] your wireless charging up here on your
[05:05] steering wheel? I mean, this is quite
[05:07] cool. So these pixels up here, they
[05:10] actually light up. You've got four and
[05:12] they reflect the state of charge. So
[05:16] hopefully you should never run out of
[05:18] energy because it's reminding you all of
[05:20] the time. Um, so that is quite useful.
[05:22] And then you will be very happy to see,
[05:27] look at that, a twisty little knob for
[05:30] the climate control. So we've got
[05:32] touchcreen here for the fan. There we
[05:35] are.
[05:37] uh but for actual physical buttons for
[05:39] the temperature gauge which is
[05:40] brilliant. And then on a day like today
[05:44] I can cool my bottom uh which comes in
[05:48] the calligraphy model uh in the top two
[05:50] tiers. So that's a nice touch. Heated
[05:52] seats, cooled seats, heated steering
[05:54] wheel. Um it's got it all including a
[05:59] special little sterilizing system for
[06:01] your phone and anything of that size.
[06:05] This is something I like.
[06:07] That is impressive. The whole central
[06:10] island moves. It's called the Universal
[06:12] Island. And when you open it up, decent,
[06:16] really decent storage space with
[06:20] a secret layer.
[06:23] So, that's where I will hide all of my
[06:26] treasure.
[06:28] The screen is really easy to use as
[06:30] well. It is nice and responsive. Shall
[06:32] we check the weather?
[06:34] Oh, what's it doing? Ah, funny that sun
[06:36] and a bit of rain. Um, the other thing
[06:40] obviously you get Apple CarPlay, Android
[06:42] Auto. The AI voice control is quite
[06:45] good. Should we give her a little try?
[06:47] Here we go.
[06:49] Can you take me to the nearest
[06:50] McDonald's?
[06:53] Please say the line number of the
[06:55] location you want to go to.
[06:57] Oh, fantastic. Yes, line number two,
[07:00] please. Do you want to be guided to this
[07:03] place?
[07:04] Yeah, I'm hungry. Now, the spec is
[07:07] pretty generous, particularly when it
[07:08] comes to the seats. First row, second
[07:11] row, heated seats. And unless you're
[07:13] getting the entry level car, they are
[07:15] also ventilated. Perfect in this kind of
[07:18] weather. I mean, it's like a TARDIS in
[07:20] here. I appreciate we can't really say
[07:22] it's a TARDIS because that would mean it
[07:23] was small on the outside and it's not.
[07:25] It's big on the outside, but it's big on
[07:27] the outside and feels even bigger on the
[07:29] inside. There's just it's just glorious.
[07:32] There's just so much space and it's
[07:34] these chairs are comfortable. I've got
[07:36] an armrest here and here. I've got
[07:38] double cup holders. I've got storage
[07:40] bin. I've got storage here. And
[07:46] I can access the universal island in the
[07:51] middle. Look at this.
[07:54] It's just so functional. And there are
[07:57] seven of these. seven, which means the
[08:01] children will never run out of power on
[08:04] the thing we're not allowed to give
[08:05] them, an iPad.
[08:08] Amen to that. So, this is the next part
[08:11] of my test. So, this seat is set to my
[08:13] driving position. 5 foot eight minus a
[08:16] half. Um, and then hand span about
[08:20] there. I mean, there's loads of room. I
[08:22] don't really need that amount. Do you
[08:23] know what? I'm going to move it forward
[08:24] a bit.
[08:27] No, that feels squashed. I want to enjoy
[08:30] this. Okay, we're back to where we were.
[08:33] This feels pleasant. Let's see how much
[08:37] space there is in the back.
[08:43] You know, normally if you sit in the
[08:45] third row of a car, your legs are like
[08:48] this. And you would never actually ask a
[08:51] normal adult to sit back here. These are
[08:54] for kids, right? Not these ones. Nope.
[08:57] And I can recline. I have space. I have
[09:00] cup holders. I have charge there.
[09:04] Honestly,
[09:06] I'm never going to want to drive again.
[09:09] This is glorious. And the best part
[09:11] about these seats, ISOIX, so the kids
[09:15] can sit here and you won't need to hear
[09:17] them cuz you'll be so far away at the
[09:19] front. And just lastly, let's appreciate
[09:22] how easy it is to get out. Is that a
[09:25] back breaker? No, I don't think so.
[09:27] Amazing access, especially how wide the
[09:29] door opens. I'm assuming that most
[09:32] people that want to buy a sixseater car
[09:35] will have all six seats up most of the
[09:37] time. I wanted to show you this for
[09:39] comparison. This is the Peugeot E508
[09:43] in its sevenseater setting. So, we've
[09:46] got the three middle bench up and the
[09:49] two seats in the back. This is how much
[09:51] boot space is left with those seats up.
[09:54] 348
[09:55] lers. Got a little yo-yo and got my
[09:58] charging cables. Come and take a little
[10:01] look at the situation here.
[10:04] Currently set up with the third row up.
[10:09] This
[10:11] This is 620 L worth of stuff.
[10:15] Now, it's not just the B50008 that has a
[10:19] small boat when all the seats are up. So
[10:22] does the ginormous Kia EV9 that actually
[10:25] has a boot space of just 333
[10:28] L in the 67 seat configuration. So my
[10:33] question to you is this. Why are you
[10:37] buying a sevenseater car? Is it for
[10:39] local visits or is it because you
[10:42] actually need to put seven people in the
[10:44] car and loads of stuff? If that's the
[10:46] case, the EV9 and the E50008 is going to
[10:50] be too small for you because you're not
[10:51] going to have enough boot space. This,
[10:53] however, you do not have to compromise
[10:55] when you're in the six sevenseater
[10:58] layout.
[11:00] This video is brought to you with
[11:01] Anderson EV, the UK's most awarded home
[11:04] charge point brand of 2024, offering
[11:07] over 200 color and finish options, a
[11:09] marketleading 7-year warranty, and a
[11:12] unique hidden tethered cable.
[11:22] Finally, the beast has been unleashed on
[11:24] the road. But before we get into all the
[11:26] driving impressions, I want to talk to
[11:27] you about noise. Now, I quite enjoy the
[11:31] calmness and the silence of driving an
[11:34] electric car. It does bring an element
[11:36] of serenity, I think, to driving now as
[11:39] opposed to back in the day. Um, and this
[11:42] has taken it to a whole new level. So,
[11:45] you know how we have noiseancelling
[11:48] headphones?
[11:49] Well, now we have a noiseancelling car.
[11:53] Uh, this basically in some rapid time of
[11:56] two thousandth of a second can basically
[12:01] listen to the sounds that is coming into
[12:03] the car and then play back the opposite
[12:06] sound to cancel it out. And okay, while
[12:10] it is not obviously completely silent in
[12:13] here, I mean, two cars just went past me
[12:15] then and I could hear them. Uh, but
[12:19] overall
[12:21] it's a fraction quieter. I would say a
[12:25] fraction is maybe a bit harsh. Quite a
[12:28] bit quieter. Okay, so I am now driving
[12:32] through a couple of fields. It is very
[12:33] windy. I can see trees blowing, bushes
[12:36] blowing in the wind, and
[12:40] I can hear the wind noise. So, I'm not
[12:43] quite sure how much cancelling actually
[12:45] occurs, but um I think maybe it just
[12:48] reduces the noise. It's still a very
[12:51] like calm and serene drive, but it's not
[12:54] completely silent. If only Hyundai could
[12:56] have come up with something to cancel
[12:57] out the noise of three children in the
[12:59] back. Now, that would be perfect.
[13:03] Let me give you some performance
[13:04] figures. So, the long range rearwheel
[13:07] drive model uses a 160 kW rear motor. If
[13:11] you step up to the longrange all-wheel
[13:13] drive, you get the same 160 kW rear
[13:15] motor paired with a 70 kW unit at the
[13:18] front. The performance all-wheel drive
[13:21] goes even further with 160 kW motors
[13:25] front and rear.
[13:27] Now, that extra power means the
[13:29] performance model sprints from naugh to
[13:31] 62 km an hour in just 5.2 seconds. The
[13:35] longrange allwheel drive follows in 6.7
[13:37] seconds, while the rearwheel drive
[13:39] version takes 9.4.
[13:42] Mid-range performance is just as
[13:44] impressive. For overtaking, the
[13:45] performance model goes from 50 to 75 mph
[13:49] in just 3.4 seconds. The all-wheel drive
[13:52] takes 4.8 and the rear wheel version
[13:54] does it in 6.8. eight.
[13:59] So, this is the long range all-wheel
[14:01] version and for something of this size,
[14:04] it is nimble. I mean, it doesn't feel as
[14:07] bulky as it looks. Although, having said
[14:09] that, squeezing into the parking spaces
[14:11] is kind of an Olympic sport, but
[14:14] generally on the road, it's impressive.
[14:16] I have driven it on a mixture of small
[14:18] B- roads, larger A roads, and on the
[14:21] motorway, and it has handled all of them
[14:22] well. Now, I think it helps because the
[14:25] enormous battery sits low in the floor.
[14:28] So, I think it helps it corner with a
[14:30] bit more grace, particularly considering
[14:31] its height as well. And also, the body
[14:34] roll I found is quite minimal. Stability
[14:37] is good. So, the handling
[14:40] is good. So, this has a total output of
[14:43] 314 kW, which is the equivalent of 423
[14:48] brake horsepower.
[14:49] Motors on the front and the rear axle.
[14:53] And yet it moves this 2.6 ton bulk with
[14:57] absolute ease. It really does.
[15:00] Now when you stamp on the accelerator,
[15:04] there's a a sort of a double
[15:06] acceleration.
[15:08] It's almost like a bit of a pause. It's
[15:10] a bit like old school turbo nostalgia
[15:12] goes electric. Um but it also feels like
[15:15] a bit of a turbo lag, which I don't
[15:17] really like. The whole point of going
[15:18] electric is you just go. You have that
[15:20] instant acceleration, but there's like a
[15:22] double. You sort of go fast, then you go
[15:24] really fast. Let's talk regen braking
[15:27] for a bit. Four different settings via
[15:29] the lovely paddles up here. Strongest
[15:31] one offers smooth one pedal driving,
[15:34] which I'm actually on right now. Perfect
[15:36] for town. Um, brake pedal is natural,
[15:39] none of that kind of weird grabby EV
[15:42] stuff that you can sometimes get. We've
[15:44] got four different driving modes: My
[15:46] drive, sport, normal, and eco. Um, I
[15:49] find this quite funny. So, put my foot
[15:52] down. I'm on, you know, high region at
[15:55] the moment.
[15:57] It's still impressive. A nice little bit
[16:00] of acceleration.
[16:02] I pop it into sport mode.
[16:08] Where did that come from?
[16:10] It's so fast. Like, that acceleration is
[16:14] wicked. Uh, so I would say I mean to be
[16:17] fair, no, I would say I'm not going to
[16:18] drive it in sport because that's too
[16:19] much power for me. Um, I am going to
[16:21] drive it in normal mode, uh, which is
[16:25] plenty of power, um, but not too much as
[16:29] you saw, but sport mode, if you want to
[16:31] have fun, it's there to play with. So, I
[16:34] think the steering maybe likes a tiny
[16:36] bit of feedback. The ride quality isn't
[16:39] always perfect over lumpy British roads.
[16:42] Although, I was also thinking about this
[16:44] because this is the top of the range
[16:45] model and it comes with those massive,
[16:48] very good-looking 21in wheels. So, maybe
[16:51] that's not helping absorb all of those
[16:53] bumps in the road. Next time, we will
[16:56] get a car with smaller wheels. Um, also,
[16:58] this doesn't get adaptive suspension or
[17:01] four-wheel steering that you might find
[17:02] on rivals like the BMW iix.
[17:06] As a result, the turning circle isn't as
[17:09] good either, which isn't ideal when
[17:12] you're trying to maneuver a wagon into
[17:15] tight spaces.
[17:18] Okay, let's talk real world range for a
[17:19] bit. So, Hyundai claims 185 mi for the
[17:23] single motor version. Now, this
[17:24] all-wheel drive model should be around
[17:26] 330 to 340 mi. I have been driving in
[17:29] mixed conditions around 250 mi so far,
[17:33] and I've been getting around 3.2 2 m per
[17:36] kowatt hour. Now, that was in eco mode,
[17:39] but I've had the AC blasting and uh the
[17:42] massage seats have not been switched
[17:43] off. So, that equates to just over 350
[17:46] mi, which is brilliant. Now, it's worth
[17:49] pointing out that this is a new car.
[17:51] It's barely run in, and that of course
[17:53] means the bigger test is going to be in
[17:55] winter. So, we will get this 9 back in
[17:58] then and try it out. Now, when it comes
[18:00] to the warranty, it's 5 years with
[18:01] unlimited mileage. The battery has 8
[18:03] years with 100,000 mi, which gives you
[18:06] plenty of peace of mind, unless you're
[18:09] planning to drive to the moon and back.
[18:12] [Music]
[18:19] Feel like it's conclusion time, isn't
[18:20] it? And this is going to be hard. I'm
[18:22] worried because there's pressure here
[18:24] because Ionic 5 and six both won world
[18:27] car. So, the question is, can the nine
[18:30] make it a hat-tick? Well, let's talk
[18:32] about the prices, shall we? It starts at
[18:34] £64,930.
[18:37] Although this topsp spec calligraphy
[18:39] model with the six seat option is quite
[18:42] a bit more, £78,530.
[18:45] Now, at the moment, there's no lease or
[18:47] finance cost available because it's a
[18:49] bit too soon. And I think that is going
[18:51] to be crucial for a car like this. So,
[18:52] we will keep a close eye on that and
[18:54] update electrifying when we know. But
[18:56] just for example, a Kia EV9 at the
[18:58] moment costs about £1,000 a month, which
[19:01] is the same as a BMW iix.
[19:05] This is something else to consider. If
[19:07] for the majority of the time you
[19:08] actually only need a fiveseater with
[19:10] just the flexibility of the seven seat
[19:13] option, then maybe take a look at the
[19:15] Peugeot E50008 cuz prices start a lot
[19:19] lower at under £49,000. But just
[19:21] remember, like I showed you earlier,
[19:23] that boot space will be compromised in
[19:25] the sevenseater setting. But if you're
[19:28] going to be six up most of the time,
[19:30] including big kids, adults with lots of
[19:33] stuff, well then I don't think you can
[19:35] really look any further than this
