[00:00] The Hyundai Ionic 9 is a bit of a weird
[00:02] one in lots and lots of ways. It's more
[00:05] car than anyone would ever need. It's
[00:07] got more USBC ports than anyone would
[00:09] ever need. It's got a a bigger battery,
[00:12] over 110 kWh battery. Again, more than
[00:15] most people would need. It's got a range
[00:17] of over 600 km, more than most people
[00:19] need. Who drives that without stopping?
[00:21] And it's massive. It's over 5 m long.
[00:25] Take for example the actual suitcases
[00:27] you can go on a long haul with. You'll
[00:30] get two of them in the back of the car
[00:33] with the third row up. Look, it's
[00:36] massive.
[00:38] [Music]
[00:46] At €78,495,
[00:49] it's also got a fairly massive price
[00:51] tag. But what do you get for that cost?
[00:54] And is it actually an all round decent
[00:57] value for money? sevenseater that just
[01:00] happens to be electric. In this video,
[01:02] I'm going to point out the pros and the
[01:04] cons. Oh, and if you're looking for a
[01:06] more regular review of what's the middle
[01:09] row like and the third row like and all
[01:10] that stuff, I've also done an early look
[01:12] at this car just a few short weeks ago.
[01:15] Same car, Ionosphere green color, so you
[01:18] can check that out as well at the end of
[01:19] the video. Take the wheelbase for
[01:20] example, 3,130
[01:23] mm. So, in the middle row in particular,
[01:27] the space is ridiculously big. And then
[01:31] you got this panoramic glass roof that
[01:32] comes as standard. You can adjust the
[01:34] angle of these seats. So, you might want
[01:36] to sit a bit more upright to give your
[01:38] third row a bit more space. Or you might
[01:40] want to lounge back and stretch out cuz
[01:43] there's so much leg room. I can
[01:44] understand why you might want to do
[01:46] that. You get window blinds to keep the
[01:48] kids happy and the sun out of their
[01:50] eyes. is you get your own individual
[01:51] climate control and even an armrest that
[01:53] opens at the rear. However, Irish cars
[01:56] don't get certain specs such as this
[01:59] movable console that you may have seen
[02:01] in the Ionic 5. What it is in many ways
[02:04] the same car as the Kia EV9, but there
[02:07] are quite a few tweaks as well. For
[02:10] example, while it sits on the same
[02:12] platform as the EV9, the drag
[02:14] coefficient is.25,
[02:16] which is better. And even the way the
[02:18] car tapers off at the rear, it's all
[02:21] designed to get air flow moving around
[02:23] the car in the most efficient way. But
[02:25] does it actually work? Because typically
[02:28] cars of this design, quite like a brick,
[02:31] aren't very efficient. Assuming quite a
[02:34] few of you want to know what this car is
[02:36] like at motorway speeds with the larger
[02:38] battery, I'd expect it's a vehicle that
[02:40] yes, it's electric, but it will be
[02:42] required to do decent journeys. So, you
[02:45] have adaptive cruise control. You have
[02:47] lane change assist. You've got lane keep
[02:49] assist. It will keep up and down with
[02:53] the vehicle in front. And it will also
[02:55] change speed depending on what the road
[02:58] signs say if you're in cruise control.
[03:00] So really, there's not an awful lot for
[03:02] you to worry about. The car will also
[03:04] change lane for you. You indicate
[03:07] it displays on the head-up display that
[03:09] it's green to go and it does it for you.
[03:12] And this system is better than the Tesla
[03:15] one as far as I'm concerned because even
[03:16] if I do input some feedback into the
[03:18] steering wheel, the whole cruise control
[03:21] system doesn't shut off. Now sometimes,
[03:25] for example, here it says road type not
[03:27] supported where it did work as you could
[03:30] see 15 seconds ago. We're at 73
[03:34] 74 dibels
[03:37] at motorway cruising speed. Now, they
[03:40] have in a kind of noise cancellation way
[03:44] with the Bose system filtered out some
[03:47] of the road noise and exterior noise.
[03:50] There's specific insulation going into
[03:53] the tires to reduce cabin noise. Also,
[03:57] it's not that there's no noise in the
[03:58] car at 120, but it it's it's pretty
[04:01] quiet. Now I'm at 50% battery um with
[04:06] 290 kilometers which really is not far
[04:10] off the claimed 610 or so km range. Very
[04:15] very impressive.
[04:18] [Music]
[04:24] Now here's one of the annoying things
[04:25] when it comes to public charging. So I'm
[04:27] trying to test the charging curve on the
[04:29] car.
[04:31] Uh, plenty of spaces here. Fast charger,
[04:34] uh, 150 kW charger, but there's a BYD
[04:38] CLU, which is a plug-in hybrid. It's
[04:41] blocking the right hand side of a fast
[04:44] charger, and they're using the slow
[04:47] charger, the AC, cuz it's a plug-in
[04:49] hybrid, and they're potentially gone for
[04:52] whatever it is, 12 hours. And that is
[04:55] one half of a charger out of action for
[04:57] 12 hours. That's annoying. The design of
[05:01] this charger setup is that the plug-in
[05:03] hybrid here on my right, which is doing
[05:05] nothing wrong, is blocking one half of
[05:07] that fast charger, and they could be
[05:10] there for hours and hours and hours, and
[05:12] I'm now stuck with a 50 kW
[05:15] in I think 20 minutes. I put in 4%. It's
[05:18] going to take over two hours and I'll
[05:20] get an overstay fee and you're paying 60
[05:24] odd for the privilege, 66 for the faster
[05:26] charger, which I can't even use. Again,
[05:28] not blaming the plug-in hybrid driver.
[05:30] They're doing nothing wrong with the
[05:31] design of this e-car charger hub is
[05:34] ridiculous. We're going to see more and
[05:35] more plug-in hybrids in the medium to
[05:38] short term because they're getting
[05:40] longer range. Some people don't want to
[05:41] go fully electric. Get all that, but we
[05:43] need a load of chargers for cars like
[05:45] this. And we need dedicated areas for
[05:47] battery electric vehicles in my opinion.
[05:49] Uh because how is this going to
[05:51] encourage people to go electric when
[05:52] they see you're getting 36 kilowatt
[05:55] charging speed from this dinosaur again?
[05:58] This minimum you're getting 250 kilowatt
[06:01] out of this thing. I should be in and
[06:03] out in 15 minutes max and I'm not. And
[06:07] you've got people circling here looking
[06:09] for a space. It's it's just a really
[06:12] really poor poor design. And these 50
[06:15] kow chargers, they have to go. They're
[06:18] not up to the purpose anymore. 10 years
[06:20] ago, 7 years ago, even maybe fine, but
[06:24] there there is no electric car really on
[06:26] the market that just spring aside. Maybe
[06:29] uh that could benefit from this anymore.
[06:31] They're just they need to go and we need
[06:33] to just just be gone, please.
[06:38] Anyway, I would be charging this car at
[06:41] home if it were me overnight at like 10
[06:44] cent a kilowatt hour rather than 66 for
[06:46] this. But I do like keeping an eye on
[06:48] the public network from time to time
[06:50] just to see what it's like. And there's
[06:53] lots of positive experiences, don't get
[06:55] me wrong. But this today, this is not a
[06:57] good one. Right. So that ridiculous
[06:59] inconvenience at 64 cent a kilowatt hour
[07:04] 13.7 by. 64 cost me just shy of €9876
[07:11] and I got 11%. And equivalent wise on
[07:16] the gasometer
[07:18] about 50 km for that. It's a general
[07:21] overview then of your efficiency at
[07:23] motorway speed and indeed the decibel
[07:26] levels. Don't say I don't cover lots of
[07:29] different topics in these video reviews.
[07:32] Nice seating position, good and high up
[07:35] commanding view of the road. You have
[07:36] obviously this little lower part that
[07:38] you can extend out. Now, obviously very,
[07:40] very useful if you're kicking back when
[07:41] you're charging, but you can extend it a
[07:44] little bit um when you're getting in and
[07:46] out of the car. It also moves for you
[07:47] when you're getting in and out to help
[07:49] with access. Uh there's plug and charge,
[07:51] plug and play for parking.
[07:54] Something that is a little bit mean, I
[07:56] think. So, you have the Blue Link
[07:58] connection. You can add on lots of
[08:01] different subscriptions with that,
[08:02] including uh a gear change sound. Now, I
[08:05] don't know if it's as good as the Ionic
[08:07] 5N, which is superb. Chef's kiss. Um,
[08:11] but there are different things you can
[08:12] add on and inevitably pay for if you
[08:15] really feel you need them. Uh, what's it
[08:18] like to drive then? Plenty of power. You
[08:20] know, just over 300 brake horsepower,
[08:22] loads and loads of electric torque as
[08:24] well on tap. So, it's never really
[08:26] wanting for power. It's quick in a
[08:27] straight line, but it is a tall vehicle.
[08:29] It's intended for carrying lots and lots
[08:32] of passengers. So, you feel the weight
[08:35] of it and it has a bit of body roll, but
[08:37] I wouldn't really expect anything less
[08:39] in this size of car. All versions
[08:41] because it's the one trim elegance in
[08:43] Ireland, you'll get the Bose 14 speaker
[08:46] sound system. It is really, really
[08:48] great. I like my tunes and they sound
[08:50] fantastic to that. You also have vehicle
[08:53] to load so you can unleash this massive
[08:55] battery if you were camping for example
[08:58] or trying to power things during power
[09:00] outages or whatever. It can do all that
[09:03] for you as well. You're spoiled with USB
[09:05] chargers. They're absolutely everywhere,
[09:07] including in the seats up to 100 uh watt
[09:09] output. In fact, Hyundai give you a
[09:12] specific cable that comes with the car.
[09:16] Very, very thick, very very heavy duty,
[09:18] and will charge things lightning fast.
[09:22] Uh, and hopefully no one has nicked that
[09:24] out of your car
[09:26] by the time you get your hands on it.
[09:28] You have this digital camera stream for
[09:31] the rear mirror. Works pretty well most
[09:33] of the time. You do get a bit of a
[09:35] reflection off the glass roof depending
[09:37] on what way the sun is. Uh obviously you
[09:39] can just flick it down to your standard
[09:40] camera then if it's annoying you.
[09:41] Thermal management of the battery so you
[09:43] can precondition it to get the fastest.
[09:46] It's up to 350 kilowatt charging. I
[09:49] think that's a bit of ahead of its time
[09:51] really particularly in Ireland. Uh you
[09:54] should be able to get 250 though easily
[09:56] enough. If I am actually uh
[09:59] preconditioning the battery now you can
[10:01] manually override it or you can use it
[10:03] with uh the nav basically going to a
[10:06] charger. Uh you have the four levels of
[10:10] regen including the iPedal max which
[10:13] means it will bring the car to a
[10:14] complete standill once you lift off the
[10:17] throttle. I've been using level three
[10:19] quite a bit. For me it's a bit of a
[10:21] sweet spot. I like it. These cameras
[10:23] that come on in your blind spot are also
[10:25] brilliant. Again, this is all stuff you
[10:27] get as standard. And if you're someone
[10:29] who doesn't like using screens for
[10:31] things like clim climate control, well,
[10:34] they have that all covered with loads
[10:35] and loads of physical buttons. And I'm
[10:37] really liking that shelf down below for
[10:39] storing my sunglasses,
[10:42] uh, AirPods, chewing gum, the usual
[10:44] stuff you want to chuck somewhere. The
[10:46] door bins, I think they're actually a
[10:47] little bit small considering the size of
[10:49] the car. Um, they could definitely be a
[10:52] bit bigger. I think a cooler box
[10:54] somewhere as well in the car with that
[10:57] huge armrest would be very very welcome.
[11:00] And Irish cars are also missing the
[11:02] ultraviolet disinfectant gadget. You do
[11:05] get it in the Santa Fe in Ireland but
[11:07] not in the Ionic 9. Again, I wouldn't
[11:10] say stripping out cuz it a very very
[11:12] highly spec car, but there are a few
[11:13] things that Irish spec cars will be
[11:16] missing in order to keep the price way
[11:19] it is. Do the driving I do at least
[11:22] anyway. I think I'll be charging this
[11:23] thing every other week. Certainly every
[11:25] 12 days or so. I've I'm driving it now a
[11:28] week and I've still got now 42% battery
[11:31] or a predicted almost 300 km range.
[11:35] That's a lot. Now, you could argue,
[11:37] well, if you're not doing those levels
[11:40] of of journeys, then why do you need
[11:42] such a a big battery? And that's why I
[11:44] do wish there was a more affordable
[11:46] version of this car just with a smaller
[11:48] battery. Everything else staying the
[11:50] same, but a smaller battery version. In
[11:52] real world terms, obviously I'm editing
[11:53] this video, but about half an hour of a
[11:56] constant 100 to 120. The worst I'm
[11:59] seeing is 19.3
[12:01] kwatt hours per 100 km. An interesting
[12:04] car, no doubt about it. If you truly do
[12:07] need something like this, and I'm going
[12:08] to have the Volvo EX90 on the channel
[12:11] very soon. That car makes this car look
[12:14] like a bargain.
[12:21] Okay, so I get that some of you may feel
[12:23] it has a face that only a mother could
[12:25] love and it probably is a split you down
[12:28] the middle type of design of car, but
[12:30] having lived with it now for a week
[12:32] versus the couple of airs I had the last
[12:34] time if I needed this car to carry the
[12:38] seven people at times to use that boot
[12:42] to charge it relatively cheaply at home.
[12:45] Yes, it has a huge battery, but if you
[12:47] have solar or you have a night rate, you
[12:49] will negate the the running cost of it.
[12:52] As a piece of engineering, it's a really
[12:55] really good car. The spec on this
[12:58] version, yes, there's only one version
[13:00] is so good. You have everything. Head-up
[13:02] display, air cooled seats, every safety
[13:05] gadget you could imagine. It really
[13:07] comes with absolutely everything. The
[13:10] Dove interior, you only get a black one
[13:12] if you get a white exterior. Most of the
[13:14] other colors like this will get the the
[13:16] Dove with a mix of black. It's a shame
[13:19] there's no sixseater version in Ireland,
[13:21] at least for now. And it's a shame that
[13:22] there isn't a smaller battery single
[13:24] motor version that brought it down even
[13:27] more because for some people it will be
[13:30] just too far out of the reach. Um, but
[13:33] if you have the funds to do it, it is
[13:36] one of the best sevenseaters on the
[13:38] market right now, regardless of fuel
[13:41] type in my opinion. What an interesting
[13:43] car. Very futuristic. You do feel like
[13:45] you're kind of jumping five years ahead
[13:47] of yourself when you get into this
[13:48] thing. Um, and that's how I genuinely
[13:51] feel about it. A very, very unique.
[13:54] Nothing else like it on the road today
[13:56] at least. And, uh, yeah, if you've got
[13:59] the pockets for it, you could do a lot
[14:01] worse than checking out the Ionic 9 from
[14:04] Hyundai. Let me know what you think.
[14:06] Would you consider one? Are you in an
[14:09] EV9 for the last couple of years? How
[14:10] have you been getting on with it? And
[14:13] any other thoughts you have about this
[14:14] car, let me know down below. I'll see
[14:16] you next time.
[14:19] [Music]
