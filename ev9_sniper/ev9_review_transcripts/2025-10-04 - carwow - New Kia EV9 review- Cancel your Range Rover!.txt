[00:00] this is the new Kia ev9 and it's a
[00:03] little bit like Adidas's new range of
[00:05] walking boots ultimately they're
[00:06] supposed to be practical comfy and user
[00:09] friendly yet it's also very very stylish
[00:11] now in this video I'm going to explain
[00:13] exactly what's good about this car by
[00:14] talking around the
[00:17] exterior CH the interior almost like a
[00:19] little trampoline for your head look try
[00:21] answer a bit technology come on it's
[00:23] okay good KY and seeing how practical it
[00:27] is I'll also reveal some of the things
[00:29] that aren't so good about it got a big
[00:31] dirty fluming raindrop on it obviously
[00:34] I'll take it for a drive yeah it's
[00:35] breaking and it's warning me and launch
[00:38] it to see how quick it is from not to 60
[00:40] MPH that's quicker than my Porsche 911
[00:42] 996 I'm Matt Watson and you're watching
[00:45] car
[00:48] wax let's have a look at the design of
[00:50] the Kia ev9 I'm a poet and I actually
[00:53] know it you know for a familyfriendly 7
[00:54] seated electric SUV it actually looks
[00:56] pretty good to be fair the rear isn't
[00:58] its best angle but it's not offense iive
[01:00] and depending on which model you go for
[01:02] you have a slightly different lower
[01:03] bumper design so the entry level air
[01:05] looks slightly different to this GT line
[01:07] and GT line S versions you do have this
[01:09] big roof spoiler there to try and make
[01:10] it look sporty and the way these lights
[01:13] are like that kind of remind me a little
[01:15] bit of a Volvo moving down the side now
[01:18] this is where it starts to look really
[01:19] good these kind of Blocky chunky wheel
[01:21] arches sort of give it a cyber Punky
[01:24] Vibe as do the wheel designs so the
[01:27] entry level car starts off on 19s but
[01:29] you can upgr to 20s if you have a GT
[01:32] line or gt line S then you have these
[01:34] 21in alloy wheels also the GT line and
[01:36] GT line S have black window surround and
[01:39] black roof bars whereas the air has
[01:41] silvery ones obviously we've got some
[01:43] blacked out rear windows to make it look
[01:45] mean and the obligatory for an electric
[01:47] car come on let's do
[01:50] it retractable door handles moving down
[01:53] the side look the doors do cover the
[01:55] cills which is good can you see but
[01:58] don't look too much inside we'll come to
[02:00] that in a moment so GT line GT line S
[02:03] have black door mirrors body colored on
[02:05] the entry level air once again here at
[02:07] the front very chunky very squared off
[02:08] very cyber Punky love it and the lights
[02:11] at the front sort of have a similarish
[02:13] shape to those at the rear so moving
[02:15] across the front very chunky very bulky
[02:17] very bold but also very square and cool
[02:19] looking I think it does help with this
[02:21] blue paint though this car doesn't come
[02:22] cheap may be called a Kia but K has gone
[02:24] up in the world and so of their prices
[02:26] so the starting price of this car
[02:27] £65,000 this one is a little more more
[02:30] expensive because it's the range topper
[02:32] it's £77,000 for a Kia is it worth it

[03:41] you'll love now on with the video the
[03:44] interior of this ev9 is rather nice it's
[03:46] quite simplistic but has various
[03:49] Contours and elements to it so it's
[03:51] interesting at the same time got this
[03:52] big digital driver's display which you
[03:54] control most of the features through
[03:56] it's reasonably responsive as you can
[03:58] see there the graphics are a bit dark
[04:00] and You' probably noticed over here look
[04:01] we got our climate control here and it's
[04:03] slightly blocked by the steering wheel
[04:05] so you do have to look around like that
[04:07] when you're driving to see what's going
[04:08] on though fortunately you do have some
[04:10] Shortcut buttons here for the
[04:11] temperature and the fan speed which is
[04:14] Handy and that's what you're going to be
[04:15] using while you're driving also you got
[04:17] some Shortcut buttons there which are
[04:20] haptic feedback touch sensitive thing is
[04:22] to just zip around through the different
[04:24] menus but more on those later in terms
[04:27] of the quality it's generally pretty
[04:28] good but as you go lower
[04:30] becomes less good and like lower down
[04:33] here less good up here nice and squidy
[04:36] but less good
[04:39] better you know what this particular car
[04:42] range topper it's quite expensive it's
[04:44] similar money to a
[04:45] BMW and the BMW does feel like a more
[04:48] luxurious product in terms of the
[04:50] material quality and if you want to see
[04:52] my full inp video review of that car
[04:53] just click on the pop out banner up
[04:55] there or follow the QR code appearing on
[04:57] the screen right now having said that
[04:58] though these seats are abs absolutely
[05:00] lovely and I like the headrest they're
[05:02] sort of like almost like a little
[05:03] trampoline for your head look it's quite
[05:06] a cool design quite like the design of
[05:08] the steering wheel as well these
[05:11] indicators they just feel kind of nicely
[05:13] damped seating position it's adjustable
[05:16] electrically steering wheel and of
[05:18] course the driving seat oh and there's
[05:22] enough adjustment with your big or small
[05:23] you'll be able to get comfy and get a
[05:25] good view out right
[05:28] storage in here there's bit of storage
[05:30] that's your wireless charging there for
[05:32] your mobile phone which kind of has it
[05:34] away under there you have some cup
[05:37] holders under here look there we go
[05:40] depends what size of items you want to
[05:42] keep in there so you could use it just
[05:43] for storage in there or for your cup
[05:45] holders let's see if I fit big bottles
[05:48] yeah that is good there's more storage
[05:50] in this bin under there can you see that
[05:52] then down here you got your USB so USB
[05:55] is there you got another USB there and
[05:57] look that's your 12 V in there all
[05:59] neatly packed Ed in here you have a
[06:02] glove drawer I like to call it rather
[06:04] than a glove box and that is big as well
[06:06] look that's quite deep very practical
[06:08] very useful but let's quickly do the
[06:10] test of the door
[06:12] bins can it hold a big bottle oh yes it
[06:17] can another thing to show you is this
[06:18] look massive massive sun visors really
[06:22] good for blocking out the sun and the
[06:24] biggest vanity mirror I've seen on any
[06:26] car which is perfect for the vein
[06:30] oh that feels nice actually H soft
[06:33] smooth
[06:36] headlining it's quite a nice place to be
[06:38] this oh there is one last thing I just
[06:39] want to show you I quite like it so when
[06:41] you turn the car off it makes this
[06:44] [Music]
[06:48] noise the K v9 comes with seven seats as
[06:51] standard but you can pay an extra ,000
[06:53] for this six-seater arrangement with
[06:54] these two individual chairs rather than
[06:56] a bench in the middle row and then you
[06:58] have a bit more functionality such as
[07:01] look comfy
[07:03] armrests and you can recline these seats
[07:06] individually like look a so that's
[07:08] really really comfy and you can slide
[07:10] them forwards and backwards you can also
[07:13] do this with them if I open this door
[07:16] pull a lever in here I can do this I can
[07:19] rotate it right all right there we go
[07:22] I'm not intirely sure why do this
[07:26] because there's not much you can do in
[07:28] this position look because
[07:30] these are the seats getting the way you
[07:32] can do it if you really want to let's
[07:35] put this back come on where's the
[07:37] [Music]
[07:40] lever right the car's beeping at me for
[07:43] some reason it's probably because I've
[07:45] got the accessories on so I can show you
[07:46] things like this look the rear windows
[07:48] they go all the way down which is good
[07:51] news and you have look some blinds if
[07:55] you want to use those you also have on
[07:57] the top spec version the GT line s
[08:00] sunroof now in the front the blind is
[08:04] manual but in the
[08:06] rear it's electric unfortunately you
[08:09] can't operate it from back here so you
[08:10] have to ask the driver to help you out
[08:12] but it is very nice having this sunroof
[08:14] it's just a shame you can't get it on
[08:15] the lower trim levels it's very roomy
[08:17] though isn't it look loads of head room
[08:19] and obviously in this configuration lots
[08:22] of shoulder room as well it's quite
[08:23] practical here we got two cup holders
[08:25] there that's quite handy because this
[08:27] will not fit in the door
[08:30] in see what will fit is just your normal
[08:33] size
[08:35] bottle you also have some pockets on the
[08:37] seat backs they're like airplane style
[08:39] folders feel quite expensive then you
[08:41] have this drawer system here so you pull
[08:44] this
[08:45] out push that back though this top bit
[08:48] here look this actually extends further
[08:50] for some reason I don't know why that is
[08:54] it just is we've got some climate
[08:56] control there so you have climate
[08:58] control here in the middle row got your
[09:01] air vents up there as well your reading
[09:03] lights your Hawks all your bits and
[09:05] pieces and the quality back here is
[09:06] pretty much identical to in the front so
[09:09] you don't feel like it in the cheap
[09:10] seats in fact these feel very luxurious
[09:12] I would definitely go for this six
[09:14] seater configuration I just like it
[09:15] anyway let's check out the space in the
[09:17] very back so if I press a button up on
[09:22] here I can slide this
[09:25] forward oh I better clean this dirt that
[09:27] I put on the seat just clean that off
[09:31] sorry have to clean this out
[09:34] afterwards now when I pull this back
[09:36] there we go let's get into position I'm
[09:38] going to get this into a position that's
[09:40] just about right for me James can you
[09:42] come and sit in in get yourself
[09:44] comfortable I'm going to move this one
[09:45] out the way so you can see what's going
[09:47] on got my beautiful assistant to help me
[09:49] here so can you just get yourself
[09:52] comfortable so you got enough knee room
[09:53] and we'll see if I'm okay so look you
[09:56] all right there James so James is all
[09:58] right look I've got enough enough knee
[10:00] room I can sort of shuffle my feet
[10:02] underneath the chair in front and the
[10:04] good thing about this six cater version
[10:05] is I can put my other foot there and
[10:07] actually because the seat base is quite
[10:10] high from the floor I don't feel like I
[10:11] got my knees up around my ears like you
[10:13] do in the back of some other SUVs and
[10:16] head ring back here is good as well it's
[10:18] actually fine for adults here in the
[10:20] very back there's cup holders there as
[10:22] well as a USBC yeah it's all pretty good
[10:25] I want to show you this though right one
[10:26] of the things I particularly like about
[10:27] this car here in the rear
[10:31] is what is
[10:33] it ah yeah just I drew a complete blank
[10:37] look down here isopix anle points here
[10:39] in the third row as well
[10:41] as there's also isopix down here there
[10:45] is something else I need to show you as
[10:46] well look see these
[10:48] buttons I can use these to alter the
[10:51] back rest in this third
[10:53] row and look how far back you can make
[10:56] it go so it is really surprisingly comfy
[10:59] I am am so impressed it's actually comfy
[11:01] in the back seats now let's check out
[11:03] the boot so with all rows of chairs in
[11:07] place you have 330 L of load space now
[11:11] to give you an idea how big that is it's
[11:12] about the same that a Volkswagen Polo
[11:15] has so that's quite good with these rear
[11:17] chairs in place as you can see there's
[11:18] no load lift as there hardly any like
[11:20] bumper protruding it's quite easy to
[11:21] then slide things in and out that is
[11:24] really good and if you look under here
[11:26] you'll see that there is a place to
[11:28] store the Loc cover I like that too now
[11:31] you do have some other features back
[11:32] here look you've got a 12v socket there
[11:35] and you've got some Poky things there
[11:37] what I'm going to do now though is lower
[11:39] these rear seats there we
[11:41] go now with the rear seats lowered you
[11:45] have 830 L of space which is pretty good
[11:49] however a Tesla Model X does have more
[11:52] overall load space and if you click on
[11:54] the pop out banner up there in the top
[11:55] right hand corner of the screen or
[11:57] follow the QR code which should be
[11:59] appearing on on the TV screen right now
[12:01] you can see my video review of that car
[12:03] if you look here the load space is
[12:05] completely flat which is really really
[12:08] good if I press these buttons I can fold
[12:11] those down and I really wish we' just
[12:13] moov that driver's seat forward a bit
[12:15] cuz that would have been seamless but
[12:17] unfortunately we didn't so I'm going to
[12:18] have to do
[12:20] [Music]
[12:22] this looks like the cameraman was as
[12:24] confused as I was as to where to go
[12:27] there sorry about that anyway let's see
[12:30] how much space there is under the Bonnet
[12:31] if you have the rear wheeel drive
[12:33] version of this car you have 90 L of
[12:35] boot space underneath the Bonnet however
[12:37] if you have the four-wheel drive version
[12:39] because there's a motor under there it
[12:40] eats into the space and then you only
[12:41] have 50 L now if you compare that to a
[12:43] Tesla Model X which regardless of which
[12:45] version you have you have 180 L of load
[12:49] space in the fruit yeah this Kia is a
[12:51] little bit off the mark and that brings
[12:52] you up to five annoying things about the
[12:54] ev9 I find the entertainment screen a
[12:57] little bit too far away and so you have
[12:59] to reach to touch it so you end up
[13:01] steadying your hand on this Ridge here
[13:03] and then you accidentally trigger the
[13:06] shortcut button so you're a bit like
[13:07] that you want to press something and
[13:08] then ah it's gone onto another screen
[13:10] let's just press that then okay there we
[13:11] go oh no it's gone on to another screen
[13:14] again no no no no it's annoying on some
[13:17] cars the middle seats when they slide
[13:19] forward to give access to the rear have
[13:20] a memory function so they go back to
[13:22] where you actually had them positioned
[13:24] but not on this car so you go like out
[13:26] you push it to get in and then when you
[13:28] pull it back
[13:30] will it go and stop at the exact same
[13:31] position no it's come all the way back
[13:33] here now so I'm going to have to get
[13:35] someone to adjust it for me you would
[13:36] think that a car such as this with so
[13:38] much technology would have a rear view
[13:40] camera with a little washer on it to
[13:42] keep it clean however it doesn't and the
[13:44] camera's mounted so low that it does get
[13:46] covered in Rog gri so you're often
[13:48] having to pop out and wipe it clean with
[13:50] your thumb so you can actually see
[13:53] what's behind you this car has a lot of
[13:55] Safety Systems which is good but it
[13:57] always defaults to having the lane
[13:59] assist and warning and the speed limit
[14:01] warning on so you have to turn them off
[14:03] if you want to disable them cuz they're
[14:04] annoying you and to do that it's quite a
[14:06] few steps so you have to go
[14:09] into
[14:10] setup let's go to vehicle let's go to
[14:13] driver
[14:15] assistance let's go to speed limit turn
[14:19] that off let's turn that off and then
[14:22] let's go back and turn off the Lan
[14:26] keeping Shenanigans turn it off so all
[14:29] set up exactly as I want the car however
[14:32] if I get out turn it off and start it
[14:34] again those two features will default to
[14:36] being on again so I have to go through
[14:37] the whole procedure and usually you
[14:38] don't figure that out until you've
[14:39] already pulled away so you're doing that
[14:41] while driving which isn't safe that is a
[14:42] problem you get with quite a lot of cars
[14:44] these days however this care has
[14:45] something special down here look that is
[14:48] a fingerprint reading sensor so you can
[14:51] configure the cot exactly as you like it
[14:53] and you touch this and it will restore
[14:55] it to your settings like seat position
[14:56] and stuff like that however this is not
[14:58] l linked to the Safety Systems so I can
[15:01] understand why they're default to on
[15:03] because you might have someone else that
[15:04] gets into the car and so it's better to
[15:05] have the safety systems on but if you
[15:07] have your fingerprint you touch it
[15:08] you're basically saying I want it set up
[15:10] as I want this car set up please set
[15:13] everything up including the safety it's
[15:14] a missed opportunity when you're just
[15:16] creeping forward in traffic on the
[15:18] brakes they make a strange gruning sound
[15:21] have a listen hear that come on do it
[15:25] again he that doesn't sound very
[15:27] expensive does it it's all bad though
[15:29] because actually if you look going have
[15:31] a look inside there is no one driving
[15:33] the
[15:34] car I'm actually driving this car by
[15:38] remote control using the key fob come
[15:40] towards me don't be
[15:42] shy I'll forgive you of that noise
[15:44] because this is kind of
[15:46] cool come on keep coming come on come on
[15:50] come on come on don't be shy come on
[15:52] come on this way come on come on it's
[15:56] okay come on there good KY you can get
[16:01] this car with some very cool seats first
[16:03] up is the Ergo motion seat so as well as
[16:05] the usual heated and cold function and a
[16:07] massage it has something called
[16:10] comfortable stretch so when you're on a
[16:12] long journey it'll run a program to help
[16:14] stretch the muscles in your back to
[16:16] reduce fatigue there's also posture
[16:19] assist which will help improve your
[16:20] posture while you're driving and Lumbar
[16:22] stabilization system which Alters the
[16:24] amount of lumbar support you have so it
[16:26] doesn't put too much pressure on your
[16:28] lower spine if you're in the seat for a
[16:29] long time but that's not all you can
[16:31] operate the front passenger seat from
[16:34] this row to give yourself a bit more
[16:36] knee room if the person in front just
[16:38] hopped out and didn't reset their seat
[16:39] and you just use these buttons here to
[16:41] alter the reclining function and move it
[16:45] forwards and backwards it could become
[16:47] problematic if you got naughty children
[16:48] and they like mess about with that while
[16:50] you're just in front of them but still
[16:52] useful to have what's more these two
[16:55] seats here in the middle of row are
[16:56] heated and cool as well another function
[16:58] is the relaxation mode so if I press
[17:01] this button here it's going to move this
[17:03] front passenger seat into the ideal
[17:06] position for just relaxing there's even
[17:10] this little under carve support there to
[17:12] lift my legs up aw that is a very nice
[17:15] position I think it's perfect for your
[17:16] posture you'll also do it on the
[17:18] driver's seat as well but it doesn't
[17:20] seem to lift this part because then
[17:21] obviously you would't be able to operate
[17:23] the pedals and that would be dangerous
[17:24] there is one more thing though I can
[17:26] fall down the third row of seats through
[17:28] the entainment screen just by pressing
[17:30] these
[17:30] buttons there we
[17:33] go that's handy if you've just taken the
[17:36] kids to school they've jumped out they
[17:37] haven't put the seats back up and now
[17:39] you need to Chuck some stuff in the boot
[17:41] then obviously once you've done your
[17:43] errands and you need to pick the kids
[17:45] back up again you can just press the
[17:47] buttons and they'll go back up though
[17:49] it's not perfect you'll see that the
[17:51] headest don't actually go back up as
[17:54] well but I suppose that's not too hard
[17:56] for the kids to P back up once they
[17:57] climbing the back so as long as you have
[17:59] the key in your pocket let's say you hop
[18:02] out you've gone shopping you picked up
[18:04] some stuff you got full ons you want the
[18:07] tailgate to open automatically don't you
[18:09] and you do get this feature on lots of
[18:10] cars and you end up swiping your foot
[18:12] underneath the bumper and it opens
[18:14] sometimes and sometimes it doesn't it's
[18:15] a real faf with this key though all I
[18:18] have to do is stand close to the boot
[18:20] like that and it knows I want to get in
[18:24] it move away and it opens no messing
[18:27] about and it always works which is a
[18:31] winner if you get a four-wheel drive
[18:34] version of the ev9 it comes with terrain
[18:36] mode so you can cycle through different
[18:38] settings and it adjusts the traction
[18:40] control to keep moving on snow mud or
[18:43] sand there's also heel descent control
[18:45] to help take you down a steep slope
[18:47] safely and for an electric car this
[18:49] four-wheel driver version has impressive
[18:51] Towing capabilities it's 2,500 maximum
[18:54] toone capability which is the same as a
[18:56] BMW iix and about as good as it gets in
[18:59] the electric world right now this car
[19:01] comes with a three pin socket now you
[19:03] can get other cars with a three pin
[19:05] socket and they'll be able to charge a
[19:06] laptop however this one has 250 volts
[19:10] and 16 amps which
[19:12] means look at
[19:17] this
[19:19] fail you can actually boil a k with
[19:24] it
[19:27] boiling
[19:34] it's boiled kettle of
[19:38] water that's rather wasteful you can get
[19:41] two different Power outputs of the k e
[19:43] v9 the entry level air car has a single
[19:46] electric motor driving the rear wheels
[19:48] with 203 horsepower then the GT line
[19:51] versions have four-wheel drive so a
[19:53] motor on each axle and a combined
[19:55] 385 horsepower also when it comes to
[19:58] range that rear wheel drive car has a
[19:59] slightly better range even though both
[20:01] cars have a 100 kwh battery the rear
[20:03] wheel drive car will do 350 Mi on a full
[20:05] charge whereas the four-wheel drive
[20:07] versions do 350 M on a full charge in
[20:10] terms of charging them you have 210 Kow
[20:15] charging capability on DC and also 11
[20:18] Kow charging on AC now which version of
[20:21] the K ev9 do I recommend you get well
[20:23] I'm going to configure my perfect car
[20:25] using the car configurator and if you
[20:27] want to see what that car is and exactly
[20:29] how much you can save on it through carw
[20:31] just click on the pop out Banner
[20:32] appearing in the top right hand corner
[20:33] of the screen or follow the QR code
[20:35] which should be appearing on the screen
[20:37] right now right let's see what this ev9
[20:39] is like to drive and I'm going to start
[20:41] off in town just general carry stuff to
[20:43] begin with driving position is great sit
[20:46] nice and high you have got a big Square
[20:48] Bonnet but it's easy to tell where the
[20:50] corners are if you at the back window
[20:51] it's good considering how far away that
[20:53] window is the steering is nice and light
[20:55] for Town work the
[20:57] brakes
[20:59] they're not overly grabby like they can
[21:00] be in some electric cars so you do find
[21:02] they're a little bit inconsistent so you
[21:04] press them and it's quite smooth and all
[21:06] of a sudden you reach a point where they
[21:07] really slam on the anchors it's like
[21:09] they got a sort of exponential thing
[21:11] going on with them terms of the
[21:13] suspension I'm very impressed with this
[21:15] car it's super super comfortable now if
[21:18] you back to back this car with something
[21:20] like a high-end Mercedes SUV which has
[21:22] air suspension this doesn't have that
[21:24] those do feel a little bit posher the
[21:27] way they go down the road but that's
[21:28] just for motoring journalists to worry
[21:30] about this car is very comfy it's just
[21:33] on really finer surfaces it does fidget
[21:35] a little bit like a really Posh Mercedes
[21:37] won't anyhow let's check out the Turning
[21:38] Circle going to enlist the help of the
[21:40] surround view cameras so I can see
[21:42] what's going on got a big dirty bluming
[21:45] raindrop on it turning Circle 12.3 M
[21:48] which is actually quite large for a car
[21:50] such as this by comparison the VW Buzz
[21:54] has a turning circle of 11 M now click
[21:56] on the pop out banner up there to watch
[21:58] my my fun video review of that car but
[22:00] thankfully the camera saw me around
[22:02] there okay and I could see where the
[22:04] curve was so I didn't worry about
[22:05] curving my wheels hopefully I'll make
[22:07] this curb and I've got to point this out
[22:09] really love that feature the fact that
[22:11] which way you indicate it shows you
[22:12] what's happening in the camera which is
[22:14] on each door mirror really good so you
[22:16] can check out your blind spot visually
[22:18] when you're making Maneuvers this car is
[22:20] so packed full of tech we got a bit more
[22:22] tech for you coming up actually just get
[22:24] out of here get on my way you can use
[22:26] these paddles to change the amount of
[22:29] regen effect when you lift off the
[22:30] accelerator there's two modes there's
[22:32] normal mode and you can put that into
[22:34] fully manual and run on full one pedal
[22:38] driving so when you lift off the brake
[22:40] it will bring it down to a complete
[22:41] standstill or you can back it off so
[22:43] it's much more gentle the regen slowing
[22:45] effect however what I do is put it into
[22:48] auto mode and then what the car will do
[22:50] is use its radar which it uses in the
[22:53] adaptive cruise control to actually work
[22:54] out how far you are from the car in
[22:56] front so now what I'm going to do is
[22:58] actually back off the regen effect and
[23:00] go towards the car in front and it's
[23:02] actually slowing me down using regen
[23:04] because it's measuring that distance it
[23:07] is brilliant here's something else
[23:08] that's brilliant look car in front of me
[23:09] stopped at the lights put my indicator
[23:11] on I'm going to let it pull away imagine
[23:13] I'm daydreaming we'll chatting you know
[23:15] when you're at a junction and person in
[23:16] front clearly not paying attention those
[23:18] kind of Lights which are just on green
[23:20] for a shortest period watch this oh I'm
[23:22] just
[23:23] daydreaming I'm getting a little warning
[23:25] then that beep said leading vehicle is
[23:27] driving on it is warmed me that the car
[23:28] front has driven off and I haven't I
[23:31] think every car should have that that's
[23:32] brilliant clever clever clever okay now
[23:35] I'm going to show you the benefit of the
[23:37] auto regen braking you are more
[23:39] efficient if you have regen braking
[23:41] actually off when the car is coasting
[23:43] because you're not losing energy while
[23:46] regen breaking because as well as like
[23:48] putting it back into the battery there
[23:49] are losses so you better to just Coast
[23:51] that's the best thing to do but
[23:52] obviously you don't want to co into the
[23:54] car in front of you so I'm accelerating
[23:55] now I'm lifting off and it's re breaking
[23:59] automatically for that car because I got
[24:01] close to it wonder what it'll make of
[24:03] this broken down car here yeah it's
[24:05] breaking and it's warning me and it did
[24:08] emergency steering then to steer around
[24:11] it it's got everything this car anyway
[24:14] back to the demonstration so I'm now
[24:16] lifting off the accelerator and the car
[24:18] in front is quite a way away so it's not
[24:20] giving me much regen braking but if I
[24:22] get close to him like this look you can
[24:24] see it it's regening Auto much more
[24:26] regen breaking cuz I'm close to the car
[24:28] and it even gave me a warning because I
[24:30] was getting too close to it that's the
[24:32] thing about K you know they are packed
[24:34] full of Kit and you get it as standard
[24:36] depending on which trim level you go for
[24:38] it's not like the German things where
[24:40] you know you pay for a top spec car and
[24:42] you have to add so many more things to
[24:44] It BMWs don't even get adapted cruise
[24:47] controler standard this has it look I'm
[24:49] just going to engage it now here we go
[24:51] there we go we Lane keeping assist
[24:53] increase the speed to 50 that's what it
[24:54] is here L I'll turn around here oh look
[24:58] stare and I'm getting all the visuals in
[25:00] that heads up display Oh look The Car in
[25:02] front's pulling over what's it going to
[25:03] do it's slowing down I'm going to follow
[25:05] him in what will
[25:07] happen oh oh oh oh oh oh look look it's
[25:11] automatically stopping there we go look
[25:14] I wasn't touching any of the pedals and
[25:16] of course when he pulls away I'll let me
[25:18] know that he's pulled away and I should
[25:19] get on the move too I'm actually waiting
[25:21] while L cleans the camera lenses it's a
[25:23] rubbish day today look at it yesterday
[25:25] was nice sunny tomorrow's nice and sunny
[25:27] but today the day that we're filming it
[25:29] is raining I want to move to California
[25:31] is there anyone in America who'd like to
[25:33] marry
[25:35] me okay let's test the performance so
[25:37] cruising along at 40 let's see how long
[25:40] it takes to get to 70 3 2 1
[25:45] [Music]
[25:47] go 70 it's quick enough is it not bad
[25:51] considering this thing weighs 2.6 tons
[25:53] that pickup was impressive now cruising
[25:56] along at 70 there's a couple of things I
[25:57] can notice one there's not much road
[26:00] noise two there is a little bit of wind
[26:02] noise from around here probably the big
[26:04] door mirrors but at speed it feels
[26:06] fairly planted comfy little bit of
[26:08] fidget coming through From the Rough
[26:10] surface which you wouldn't be getting if
[26:12] you had a luxury German SUV with air
[26:16] suspension but it's it's just a tiny
[26:18] tiny you complaint this car for most
[26:21] people they going to find it super comfy
[26:23] will they find it efficient enough
[26:25] though this one's averaging 2.3 mes per
[26:28] KW hour and when you consider that it's
[26:30] got a 100 KW battery that means the real
[26:34] world range in this car I'm achieving
[26:36] right now 230 Mi supposed to do 313 M on
[26:40] a full charge so that's a little less
[26:42] than 75% at the claimed range all right
[26:45] I'm going to check out the handling now
[26:47] so I'm going to put the car into sport
[26:49] mode Oho the seats gripping my body a
[26:52] little bit firmer give me a hug stud it
[26:54] on it's added a bit of weight to the
[26:55] steering doesn't do anything to the
[26:57] suspension but it does make the throttle
[26:59] response a bit more Zippy maybe I should
[27:01] have done that 40 to 70 test in this
[27:04] mode feels a bit quicker so quick that I
[27:06] got too close to the car in front and it
[27:08] dled me off again one thing to note is
[27:10] that while the steering feels nice and
[27:12] light in town which is good even in
[27:14] sports mode well it has a bit more
[27:16] weight what I find is it's a little bit
[27:18] unnatural so what you want from a car is
[27:21] the more you turn the steering wheel the
[27:23] more the steering wheel weights up as
[27:25] load goes through the tires but in this
[27:27] it doesn't doesn't seem to it just seems
[27:29] the same kind of resistance wherever you
[27:31] are regardless of what you're doing
[27:34] however the steering does put the car
[27:36] exactly where you want it to go and
[27:38] considering this thing is heavy and big
[27:41] it actually goes around corners really
[27:43] really well I think the only issue I
[27:46] have with it is the fact you can't
[27:47] really tell how much grip you've got
[27:48] with those front tires but it will
[27:50] easily do the speed limit on a twisty
[27:52] Road such as this completely unfazed
[27:55] which is all you can really ask for
[27:57] isn't it it handles better than I
[27:59] thought it would I'm quite impressed
[28:00] it's actually a really good car to drive
[28:02] I like it very muchly anyway one last
[28:05] thing to test gear says this four-wheel
[28:07] drive version of the ev9 will do not to
[28:09] 60 in 5.3 seconds speci timing gear is
[28:13] prepped and ready let's go on to Auto
[28:15] hold and then no that's not Auto hold
[28:17] let's go on to Auto hold engage now and
[28:20] floor it see what time we can get on
[28:22] this horrible miserable wet
[28:25] day it's going for it
[28:28] [Music]
[28:34] it stops really well as
[28:36] well that's a sub 5c time in a massive
[28:40] Kia electric SUV that's quicker than my
[28:43] Porsche 911 996 Bonkers and rather
[28:50] brilliant so then what's my final
[28:52] verdict on the Kia ev9 should you avoid
[28:55] it consider it short list it or just go
[28:57] right ahead and buy it well I reckon you
[28:59] should just go right ahead and buy the
[29:02] ev9 if you're after a stylish well
[29:04] equipped and very very practical
[29:07] electric
[29:08] SUV hey if you enjoyed the video please
[29:11] give it a like it really helps us out
