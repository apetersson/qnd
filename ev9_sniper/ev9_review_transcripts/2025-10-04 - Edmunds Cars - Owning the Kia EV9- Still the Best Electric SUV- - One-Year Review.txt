[00:00] RYAN GREGER: Other than a couple luxury cars,
[00:03] usable electric three-row SUVs pretty much
[00:06] didn't exist until the Kia EV9 came along.
[00:09] [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:12] This is our Kia EV9, the car we've
[00:15] had for the last 12 months as part of our one-year road test
[00:18] fleet, which includes about 20 or so other vehicles too.
[00:21] In that time, tons of folks on our staff have driven the EV9.
[00:25] It's been everything from a commuter,
[00:27] to a family hauler, and everything in between.
[00:29] We've gotten to know this car way better
[00:31] than we could have with just a few hours at the dealership
[00:34] and a test drive.
[00:35] We're going to tell you everything.
[00:37] And there's a lot of good here, but we
[00:39] do have a few complaints too.
[00:40] And, of course, we'll dive into how much our maintenance costs
[00:43] were and what the car is worth after a year and roughly 8,500
[00:47] miles of driving.
[00:48] All right, let's get into it.
[00:52] Most automakers don't put in a ton of effort
[00:55] when it comes to things like headrest comfort.
[00:57] That's not the case here.
[00:58] These mesh headrests are absolutely wonderful.
[01:02] They're like cushy little hammocks for my head.
[01:05] It's little bits of extra effort like that
[01:07] really make this interior feel special and luxurious.
[01:10] Kia really paid attention to all the details in here
[01:13] and, honestly, they nailed the execution.
[01:16] WILL KAUFMAN: You know those little motors that control
[01:19] the seats and the windows?
[01:20] In the EV9, they are almost silent.
[01:23] It's little details like that just
[01:26] add up and make the car feel really well thought out.
[01:29] RYAN GREGER: We also like that while, yes, the EV9 does
[01:31] have these big digital displays up front, like many other EVs,
[01:35] you can still get a lot done without taking
[01:36] your eyes off the road because there's plenty
[01:38] of physical controls around.
[01:40] Plus, again, unlike many other EVs,
[01:42] the EV9 has standard Apple CarPlay and Android Auto.
[01:46] The interior looks great without any
[01:48] of that touchscreen-only minimalist nonsense.
[01:51] It just works.
[01:52] CARRIE KIM: There are so many details
[01:54] that are fun, that are different than your regular car.
[01:57] This feels like almost a living room.
[02:01] RYAN GREGER: And it feels just as nice for passengers
[02:03] as it does for the driver.
[02:04] Materials in the back of the car are just as top notch
[02:07] as they are up front.
[02:08] And there's cupholders and USB ports at every seat.
[02:11] Plus, it's easy to get into the third row
[02:13] thanks to this one-touch mechanism.
[02:14] And there's plenty of space back there.
[02:16] RONALD MONTOYA: One of the things
[02:18] I liked about the Kia EV9 is that, even in the third row,
[02:20] you can fit people that are pretty tall.
[02:22] I had a couple of 6-foot people sit in the back for a short
[02:25] distance And they were able to fit just fine.
[02:27] Even the headroom was good.
[02:28] And that's not something that you
[02:30] could do with a Tesla Model Y or X because of the way
[02:33] the roof is shaped.
[02:34] RYAN GREGER: But, of course, if you buy an EV9,
[02:36] you're going to spend most of your time behind the wheel.
[02:39] And, thankfully, that's a pretty great time, too,
[02:41] largely thanks to its comfort and power.
[02:44] [MUSIC PLAYING]
[02:46] CARRIE KIM: As the daily driver of a Subaru Ascent,
[02:49] the EV9 was a major upgrade.
[02:52] I was a little worried.
[02:53] It seemed big, but it didn't feel nearly as big
[02:56] when I was behind the wheel.
[02:57] It was very comfy.
[02:59] I felt very coddled on my drive down the 405.
[03:01] RYAN GREGER: And there's a lot of great driving tech here
[03:04] that makes your life just a bit easier.
[03:06] Kia makes a lot of great stuff standard on the EV9
[03:10] and especially on this well equipped GT Line trim.
[03:12] Some of the features really stood out.
[03:14] BRAIN WONG: The EV9's 360-degree surround view camera system is
[03:18] phenomenal.
[03:19] It's big, high resolution picture
[03:21] takes up the whole screen.
[03:22] And I love that it has a dedicated camera button.
[03:25] That's a feature that I use often
[03:27] because you want to see what's around you,
[03:29] not only when you're going in reverse.
[03:31] I also really enjoy Kia's blind spot monitor system
[03:34] in the instrument cluster.
[03:35] All this good tech just makes driving easier.
[03:38] RYAN GREGER: We were also impressed by the adaptive cruise
[03:40] control and the system's ability to change lanes automatically.
[03:44] And you'll be able to cover a solid amount of ground here.
[03:47] As far as three-row electric SUVs go, the EV9's range is good
[03:51] and it has super fast charging capabilities.
[03:53] WILL KAUFMAN: I took a road trip in the EV9 with my family.
[03:56] And when the range started running low,
[03:58] I found a charger near my hotel and I spent about half an hour
[04:03] there, taking some much needed alone time,
[04:06] to add back over 200 miles of range to the vehicle.
[04:10] EV9's fast charging really makes a difference-- half an hour
[04:13] I can get away for.
[04:14] If it had been an hour, it would have been a real hassle.
[04:16] RYAN GREGER: On the right charger,
[04:18] you can get from 10% to 80% in less than 25 minutes, which
[04:21] is seriously impressive.
[04:23] One of our EV9's hardest challenges in the last year
[04:26] was a comparison test against the excellent Rivian R1S.
[04:29] And the Kia came out on top.
[04:31] It's not better at everything, but the EV9
[04:34] is so well-rounded and likable that it's easy for us
[04:36] to recommend.
[04:37] So easy to recommend, in fact, that we gave it
[04:39] our top rated Best of the Best award for 2024.
[04:42] And it's still our top rated electric SUV for 2025.
[04:46] There's just so much to here-- style, space, tech, comfort,
[04:50] range, build quality, you name it.
[04:52] So, yeah, the EV9 is pretty fantastic.
[04:55] But as great as it is, there's still some room for improvement.
[04:59] Come on now.
[04:59] Let's keep it together.
[05:01] Keep us in our lane.
[05:02] It's not that hard.
[05:04] Some of the driver aids are great.
[05:06] The adaptive cruise control, the auto lane change,
[05:09] the 360 camera, the blind spot camera.
[05:11] Love them.
[05:12] Kia's lane centering, however--
[05:14] eh, it's just not very good at handling curves
[05:18] and something about the tuning just doesn't quite feel right.
[05:21] It's too aggressive.
[05:23] CLINT SIMONE: So the lane keeping system in the EV9
[05:25] is just not it.
[05:26] The problem is if it feels even a slight nudge from your hand,
[05:30] the steering assistance cuts out completely.
[05:32] But then, at the same time, you have
[05:33] to have your hand on the steering wheel for the system
[05:36] to be working to begin with.
[05:37] So sometimes it's just so touchy feely that I don't even
[05:41] bother turning it on.
[05:41] RYAN GREGER: We had a couple nitpicks with the tech
[05:44] and usability inside too.
[05:45] Like we said, the EV9 is mostly good here,
[05:48] but there are a few things that you could shrug off
[05:50] in a test drive that would certainly
[05:52] start to wear on you after a full year of ownership--
[05:54] like these buttons.
[05:56] DUNCAN BRADY: It's cool how the buttons
[05:58] shine through the dash instead of being a physical button.
[06:01] I like that.
[06:01] It's very smooth, very sleek, whatever.
[06:03] And it's cool that they give you some tactile feedback
[06:06] so the system lets you know that it registered your input.
[06:08] But you have to be really specific where you press.
[06:11] That's annoying.
[06:12] And it's in prime real estate.
[06:14] That's where I like to anchor my phone
[06:15] so I can make more accurate touch inputs when I'm on the go.
[06:20] I hope they can fix this.
[06:21] RYAN GREGER: And that's not the only issue with these buttons.
[06:23] In direct sunlight, they're almost completely
[06:25] washed out, which makes them really hard
[06:27] to use on a sunny day.
[06:29] We also came across a couple of ergonomic issues,
[06:32] mainly that certain frequently used controls
[06:35] can be weirdly hard to see.
[06:37] We've had a similar problem in vehicles like the new Toyota
[06:40] Prius, where part of the gauge cluster
[06:42] is blocked by the steering wheel.
[06:43] But here in the EV9, the problems
[06:45] start just about as soon as you get into the car.
[06:47] NICK YEKIKIAN: I really don't like where the starter button is
[06:50] placed on the EV9.
[06:50] It's on this little stalk that juts out
[06:52] from the steering column.
[06:53] And every time I get in, I have to either fumble around
[06:55] with the thing or crane my neck to see
[06:57] where it is to start it up.
[06:59] Also, that little climate control screen
[07:00] that's in between the instrument cluster
[07:02] and the infotainment screen is completely useless.
[07:04] It's also perfectly blocked by the steering wheel.
[07:06] And you might as well just press the button
[07:08] to bring up the controls on the main display
[07:10] because the buttons are too small to press anyway.
[07:12] RYAN GREGER: Some of those controls
[07:13] you'll get used to with some more time behind the wheel,
[07:15] but that climate screen--
[07:17] that is still annoying no matter what.
[07:20] Speaking of, many EV owners or even friends of EV owners
[07:24] know or have heard about how difficult and annoying
[07:27] public charging can be.
[07:29] Now, that's no fault of the EV9 itself,
[07:31] but it is a reality of EV ownership right now.
[07:34] ANDY WHITE: EV9 is a great electric SUV,
[07:35] as long as you can stay relatively close to home.
[07:38] We took one just 90 minutes out of town to Santa Barbara
[07:41] and quickly discovered the realities
[07:43] of charging on anything but the supercharger network--
[07:47] slow charge speeds, inability to pair, error codes.
[07:51] And this is in the heart of Southern California.
[07:54] If it's not good here, the infrastructure
[07:56] is not good anywhere.
[07:57] RYAN GREGER: Good news is the Tesla Supercharger
[07:59] network has actually just recently been opened up
[08:02] to all Kia EVs.
[08:03] And any buyers who purchase their Kia EV
[08:06] after September 2024 will get adapters for free.
[08:09] That's huge.
[08:10] Tesla Superchargers are way more common than other charging
[08:13] stations, like EVgo or Electrify America,
[08:16] and they're more reliable too.
[08:18] So hopefully that'll make charging a lot easier for folks
[08:20] that can't do it at home.
[08:22] One of the major benefits of EVs is
[08:23] that they have fewer moving parts, which
[08:25] means there's potential for increased reliability and lower
[08:29] maintenance cost.
[08:30] So how'd this guy do?
[08:32] We've had no real problems with our EV9.
[08:35] Now, granted, it's only got about 8,500 miles on it,
[08:37] which means there's been fewer chances for things to go wrong,
[08:40] especially compared to some other vehicles in our fleet that
[08:43] have closer to 12,000 or 15,000 miles.
[08:45] Still, no error codes, no unplanned dealer visits,
[08:49] no recalls--
[08:50] last year we owned a Chevy Blazer
[08:52] EV for about the same amount of miles
[08:53] and let's just say things were quite a bit more dramatic.
[08:57] CLINT SIMONE: We've had so many problems with this car.
[08:59] RYAN GREGER: Our nitpicks here still stand,
[09:01] but they're much easier to forget
[09:02] about in a car that's never given us any mechanical trouble.
[09:05] [MUSIC PLAYING]
[09:08] At over $75,000, our EV9 GT Line was, at the time,
[09:13] the most expensive vehicle Kia had ever sold.
[09:16] That can be a hard number to swallow, especially
[09:19] for a brand that built its name on value.
[09:21] But, remember, you can easily spend more money on something
[09:24] like a Chevy Tahoe that has a similar amount
[09:26] of interior space.
[09:27] So was the Kia worth it?
[09:29] The short answer is a resounding yes.
[09:32] The interior and overall build quality are more than
[09:34] on par with the car's price point and it's way,
[09:38] way better than something like our older Tesla Model Y. Plus,
[09:41] the range and fast charging speeds
[09:43] are more than competitive with other electric SUVs,
[09:45] like the Rivian R1S.
[09:46] The comfort and noise levels are also on par with other vehicles
[09:49] around $75,000.
[09:51] So, yeah, it's worth the money.
[09:54] Even the $65,000 version delivers a lot of what we like
[09:57] about the EV9, but we do think the GT Line is worth ponying up
[10:01] the extra cash.
[10:02] As for what it's worth now--
[10:03] when we brought it in to a dealer for appraisal,
[10:05] they offered us $52,000.
[10:08] That's really good.
[10:10] Sure, losing $25,000 in a year never feels great,
[10:14] but that's a much lower depreciation than what
[10:16] we've seen from other EVs in our one-year road test fleet.
[10:19] [MUSIC PLAYING]
[10:21] So what have we learned?
[10:22] We bought this EV9 because it impressed us so much
[10:25] in our initial round of testing that it won our highest
[10:28] honor, Top Rated award.
[10:30] That recognition is a celebration of a great vehicle,
[10:32] but we're just trying to help regular people figure out
[10:35] what car to buy.
[10:35] So we wanted to put it under even more scrutiny
[10:38] and see if it truly holds up and still deserves our endorsement
[10:40] after a full year of hard testing.
[10:43] And--
[10:44] WILL KAUFMAN: You get three rows in an SUV
[10:46] that puts luxury SUVs from just a few years ago to shame.
[10:50] It's great.
[10:51] NICK YEKIKIAN: The EV9 is Top Rated because of how spacious
[10:53] it is inside and its super comfy ride.
[10:55] CARRIE KIM: It fits anyone.
[10:57] You can have a family, you can be an active couple,
[11:00] you can be on your own and you'll enjoy the EV9 the same.
[11:04] BRAIN WONG: From its technology to its highly functional
[11:06] interior, everything is easy to use.
[11:09] CLINT SIMONE: The EV9, really simply put,
[11:10] is still the best electric three-row on sale today.
[11:14] The market is starting to catch up.
[11:16] The alternatives are getting closer and closer.
[11:18] But as of right now, in this moment,
[11:19] that's still the best one.
[11:21] WILL KAUFMAN: Kia and Hyundai's EV tech
[11:22] is some of the best in the mainstream segment.
[11:25] And they put it in a package that is useful for families
[11:28] and just feels nice.
[11:30] RYAN GREGER: I love this thing and, honestly, I'm
[11:32] really going to miss it.
[11:33] What do you think?
[11:34] Are you in the market for a three-row electric vehicle?
[11:37] Would you rather check out Volkswagen's electric van,
[11:39] the ID.Buzz.
[11:40] Tell us below in the comments.
[11:42] We read them all.
